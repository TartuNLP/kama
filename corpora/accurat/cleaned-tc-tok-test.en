language , literature , performing arts , visual arts , architecture , crafts , the cinema and broadcasting are all part of Europe &apos;s cultural diversity .
the aim of the European Union is double : to preserve and support this diversity and to help make it accessible to others .
cultural industries in the EU - cinema and audiovisual , publishing , music and crafts - are important sources of revenue and of jobs , employing about seven million people .
the Union has an economic responsibility towards this sector and it aims to ensure the right conditions in which European industries can compete internationally .
so the EU runs support programmes for certain cultural industries , encouraging them to grasp opportunities offered by the single market and digital technologies .
it is also striving to create a dynamic environment for these industries by cutting red tape , providing easier access to funding , helping with research projects and encouraging more cooperation with partners inside and outside the Union .
the Union also includes a cultural dimension in many of its other policy areas such as education ( including language-learning ) , scientific research , support for new technologies and the information society , and social and regional development .
for example , the European Social Fund supports Italy &apos;s Arturo TOSCANINI Foundation which , since the middle of the 1990s , has run training courses for out-of-work musicians .
the specific objectives of the current Culture programme are to promote the awareness and the preservation of cultural items of European significance ; to promote the transnational mobility of those working in the cultural sector ; to encourage the transnational circulation of works and cultural and artistic products ; to stimulate intercultural dialogue .
media programmes , whose aim is to make the European audiovisual sector more dynamic and more competitive , have been running since 1990 .
each year , one or two cities are selected as cultural capitals of Europe , thereby qualifying for financial support .
linguistic diversity is a cultural and democratic cornerstone of the European Union .
language not only opens doors to other cultures , it also enriches in a practical way our ability to benefit from cultural contacts when we travel or work in other countries .
it is estimated that more than 40 million people in the EU speak a native language which is not the official language of their country of origin .
the aim of the common agricultural policy is to provide farmers with a reasonable standard of living , consumers with quality food at fair prices and to preserve our rural heritage .
surplus beef and butter mountains , and milk lakes have been a thing of the past for two decades as a result of a first wave of reforms .
television is our primary source of information and entertainment .
we each spend , on average , up to three hours a day watching news , sports , films and other programmes .
each national government runs its own audiovisual policy , while the Union sets rules and guidelines where common interests , like open EU borders and fair competition , are concerned .
to protect its own cultural diversity and promote local productions , the EU sought and secured at the World Trade Organisation what became known as the ‘ cultural exception ’ .
the pace of technological innovation has led to the convergence of broadcasting and telecommunications .
open frontiers and affordable transport have given Europeans unprecedented levels of personal mobility .
goods are shipped rapidly and efficiently from factory to customer , often in different countries .
the European Union has contributed by opening national markets to competition and by removing physical and technical barriers to free movement .
but today &apos;s transport patterns and growth rates are unsustainable .
the ability to move people and goods quickly , efficiently and cheaply is a central tenet of the EU &apos;s goal for a dynamic economy and cohesive society .
the removal of barriers to cross-border trade and travel has increased the volume of long-distance goods and passenger transport .
although many aspects of transport policy come under national governments , it makes sense for the European single market to have a single transport infrastructure .
in the last ten years , the EU has opened national transport markets across the Union to competition , particularly in the road and air sectors and , to a lesser extent , for rail .
as a result , trucks can operate in countries other than their own , so that they no longer return empty on international journeys .
road haulage now carries 44 % of all goods transported in the EU , against 39 % for short-sea shipping routes , 10 % for rail and 34 % for inland waterways .
shifting goods and passengers from roads to less polluting forms of transport will be a key factor in any sustainable transport policy .
the European Union ( EU ) is a family of democratic European countries , committed to working together for peace and prosperity .
es is not a State intended to replace existing States , nor is it just an organisation for international cooperation .
the historical roots of the European Union lie in the Second World War .
the idea was born because Europeans were determined to prevent such killing and destruction ever happening again .
in the early years , the cooperation was between six countries and mainly about trade and the economy .
now the EU embraces 27 countries and 490 million people , and it deals with a wide range of issues of direct importance for our everyday life .
Europe is a continent with many different traditions and languages , but also with shared values such as democracy , freedom and social justice .
in the increasingly interdependent world of the 21st century , it is more necessary than ever for every European citizen to work together with people from other countries in a spirit of curiosity , openness and solidarity .
you can travel across most of the EU without carrying a passport and without being stopped for checks at the borders .
the story of EU in 10 steps , from the Schuman Declaration and the six-nation EU of the 1950s to its 2007 enlargement to include 27 countries .
on 9 May 1950 , the Schuman Declaration proposed the establishment of a European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) , which became reality with the Treaty of Paris of 18 April 1951 .
customs duties between the six countries were completely abolished on 1 July 1968 and common policies , notably on trade and agriculture , were also put in place during the 1960s .
June 1979 saw a decisive step forward for the European Community , with the first elections to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage .
the political shape of Europe was dramatically changed when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 .
in March 2000 , the EU adopted the “ Lisbon strategy ” for modernising the European economy and enabling it to compete on the world market with other major players such as the USA and the newly industrialised countries .
there is so much for the traveller to discover and all this has been made much easier thanks to the European Union .
you can cross many borders within the EU without being checked and the euro makes it easier to shop around for bargains .
a green card is not obligatory when travelling in the EU but it serves as internationally recognised proof of insurance and it makes it easier to settle claims arising from an accident .
creating a single European market in air transport has meant lower fares and a wider choice of carriers and services for passengers .
the EU has 210,000 km of railways with extensive international passenger services .
there are high-speed lines in several countries with trains reaching speeds of up to 300 km / h and the network is being extended this year with new links in Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Spain and the United Kingdom .
situated on the Baltic coast , Latvia is a low-lying country with large forests that supply timber for construction and paper industries .
Latvia also produces consumer goods , textiles and machine tools .
ethnically , the population is 59 % Latvian and 29 % Russian , and more than a third live in the capital Riga .
founded , in 1201 , Riga is the largest city in the three Baltic states with a population of 730,000 .
the unicameral Latvian Parliament , the Saeima , is elected by direct , popular vote every four years .
the president is elected by the Parliament , also every four years .
characteristic specialities of Latvian cuisine are bacon pies and a refreshing , cold sour cream soup .

the goal of the workshop is to provide the participants with an opportunity to exchange ideas , approaches and implementations of computational systems , to highlight the common challenges faced by all practitioners , to assess the state of the art in the field , and to identify promising areas for future collaborative research .
the conference series attracts a wide audience which includes translators , business managers , researchers and language experts .
once again , this year the conference will address the latest developments in translation ( and translation-related ) software .
it will address the needs of the following conference attendees : industry , public administration , agencies , freelancers and development .
the current trend of information exchange on the Internet to become ever more multilingual has stimulated new important developments in the field of multilingual NLP .
recently there has been an increased interest in the automated discovery of equivalent expressions in different languages .
new interesting directions have sprung up , such as the use of the Web and comparable corpora for this task , and new kinds of lexical phenomena , such as multiword expressions and named entities , have come into focus .
this workshop will bring together researchers working on a broad range of problems related to the management of multilingual lexical resources - their acquisition , maintenance , customization , and re-use .
the scope of the workshop includes evaluation of multilingual lexicons intended for a broad range of applications : from personalized glossaries for a translation project to large-scale machine-readable dictionaries and databases .
the international thermonuclear experimental reactor , a major experimental facility which is aimed at demonstrating the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power .
research and innovation help deliver jobs , prosperity and quality of life .
following successful developments in recent years , fusion energy research and development has reached the point where effective progress towards the demonstration of the generation of sustainable energy from nuclear fusion can be envisaged .
“ Knowledge is a key component of competitiveness ” said European Science and Research Commissioner Janez Potočnik .
if our businesses are to be at the leading edge in the future , they need to invest in knowledge now and governments need to put in place the appropriate measures to help them do so .
the EU is part of a globalised world where knowledge is more evenly distributed than ever before .
nuclear fusion offers the prospect of an almost limitless supply of clean energy for the long term .
the low level of private R &amp; D expenditure in Europe in comparison with the US is mostly due to differences in industrial structure and to the smaller size of the high-tech industry in the EU .
regarding research excellence , although the EU is the world &apos;s largest producer of scientific knowledge , the impact of European science is lower than that of the US .
Europe lags behind the US in all scientific disciplines in terms of citation impact scores and highly-cited publications .
also , EU universities are very much underrepresented at the top of a ranking based on bibliometric indicators of the world &apos;s largest universities .
in addition , the linkage between technology ( patented inventions ) and the science base is much weaker in the EU than in the US .
Europe has a difficulty in breaking through in new high-tech industries .
a new era of research and development funding began today with the adoption of proposals by the European Commission to launch the first ever Europe-wide public-private R &amp; D partnerships .
Europe needs a new approach to research in certain promising areas for our competitiveness and well-being .
these are areas where national , European and industrial funding for research can yield significant added value in particular by creating incentives for increased private research and development spending .
the invisible computers ( embedded systems ) today run all machines from cars , planes and phones , from energy networks and factories to washing machines and televisions .
forecasts predict there will be over 16 billion embedded devices by 2010 and over 40 billion devices worldwide by 2020 .
by 2010 these invisible chips will represent 30-40 % of the value of new products in consumer electronics ( 41 % ) , telecommunications ( 37 % ) , automotive ( 36 % ) and health equipment ( 33 % ) .
the innovative Medicines Initiative , will support the development of new knowledge , tools and methods so that better and safer medicines can be made available more quickly .
today the European Commission is putting forward its ideas for a European research area that makes the most of Europe &apos;s knowledge potential .
the Commission &apos;s vision is to tap this potential by providing the freedom for people , infrastructures , organisations , funding , knowledge circulation and global co-operation to operate effectively .
better generation and use of knowledge is crucial if the EU is to achieve its economic , social and environmental ambitions , as outlined in the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs .
our future depends on Europe becoming a true knowledge society .
the European Research Area is the foundation on which this knowledge society must be built .
businesses find it difficult to form partnerships with universities , especially across borders .
researchers still come up against obstacles to career development or which prevent them from moving to do research elsewhere in the EU .
national and regional funding remains largely uncoordinated and so lacks efficiency .
the exploitation of research results could be significantly improved .
the document is accompanied by guidelines to help research institutions improve their links with industry , which highlight good practice on the management and transfer of knowledge and intellectual property .
adequate flow of competent researchers , with high levels of mobility between institutions , disciplines , sectors &amp; countries , is one of the main axes .
the aim of the directive is to achieve a good level of water quality for all rivers , lakes , estuaries , coastal waters and groundwater in the European Union by 2015 .
sustainable water management is vital to protect biodiversity , the well-being of citizens and the competitiveness of European industries .
participating partners will stand to gain from increased visibility , increased R &amp; D capacity , better financial incentives , and reduced costs of risk-taking .
companies will be directly involved in research and education activities , thereby helping to nurture an entrepreneurial mindset among graduates and researchers .
the European Commission has today taken a position on how best to modernise Europe &apos;s universities .
European universities have enormous potential , much of which unfortunately goes untapped because of various rigidities and hindrances .
freeing up the substantial reservoir of knowledge , talent and energy requires immediate , in-depth and coordinated change : from the way in which systems are regulated and managed , to the ways in which universities are governed .
although universities train and teach millions of people each year , Europe &apos;s higher education systems remain hampered by a number of obstacles , many of which are decades old .
universities are power-houses of knowledge generation .
universities will need to adapt to the demands of a global , knowledge-based economy , just as other sectors of society and economy have to adapt .
each institution should find the balance of education , research and innovation which is best suited to its role in its region or country .
the aim is to create a framework within which universities can become stronger players in the global knowledge society and economy .
the Commission stands ready to support the modernisation of EU universities through a process of identifying and sharing good practice , and through its funding programmes for education , research and innovation .
the European Commission identifies 9 areas where changes should be made so that Europe &apos;s universities can contribute to the creation of a true knowledge economy .
one of the proposals is to allow students to make use of national loans and grants wherever in the EU they decide to study or do research .
we have to review national student fee and support schemes so that the best students can participate in higher education and further research careers whatever their background .
we have to review systems for funding universities , to be more focused on outputs and give universities more responsibility for their own long-term financial sustainability , particularly in research .
we must allow universities greater autonomy and accountability , so that they can respond quickly to change .
this could include revising curricula to adapt to new developments , building closer links between disciplines and focussing on overall research areas domains ( e.g. renewable energy , nanotechnology ) rather than disciplines .
it could also include more autonomy at individual institution level for choosing teaching and research staff .
in all EU countries seat belts must now be worn in all vehicles , including tourist coaches and minibuses .
remember to drive on the left side of the road in Cyprus , Ireland , Malta and the United Kingdom and remember that in some countries , such as Belgium , France , the Netherlands and Portugal , you normally have to give way to traffic coming from your right .
using a mobile phone while driving greatly increases the risk of a fatal accident and it is either explicitly or implicitly forbidden in all EU countries .
although in the majority of EU countries the maximum permitted blood alcohol level is 0.5mg / ml , in others it varies between 0.2 mg / ml and 0.8 mg / ml ( 0.9mg / ml in Cyprus ) and some countries do not allow any alcohol in the blood while driving .
travelling in the EU , your car insurance policy will automatically provide the minimum cover ( third party liability ) required by law .
the speed limit on motorways is generally 110 , 120 or 130 km / h and the limit in built-up areas is 50 or sometimes 60 km / h .
as an air passenger you have certain rights when it comes to information about flights and reservations , damage to baggage , delays and cancellations , denied boarding , compensation in the case of accident or difficulties with package holidays .
these rights apply to scheduled and chartered flights , both domestic and international , from an EU airport or to an EU airport from one outside the EU , when operated by an EU airline .
new regulations have been introduced concerning the liquids that passengers can carry past airport screening points in their hand baggage .
the liquids ( including creams , gels , toothpaste , sprays , perfume ) must be in individual containers with a maximum capacity of 100ml .
passengers are allowed liquids such as drinks and perfumes bought in the departure area .
reflecting the will of the citizens and States of Europe to build a common future , this Constitution establishes the European Union , on which the Member States confer competences to attain objectives they have in common .
the Union shall coordinate the policies by which the Member States aim to achieve these objectives , and shall exercise on a Community basis the competences they confer on it .
the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities .
the peoples of Europe , in creating an ever closer union among them , are resolved to share a peaceful future based on common values .
conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage , the Union is founded on the indivisible , universal values of human dignity , freedom , equality and solidarity ; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law .
the Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these common values while respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe as well as the national identities of the Member States and the organisation of their public authorities at national , regional and local levels ; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable development and ensures free movement of persons , services , goods and capital , and the freedom of establishment .
it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes in society , social progress and scientific and technological developments by making those rights more visible in a Charter .
enjoyment of these rights entails responsibilities and duties with regard to other persons , to the human community and to future generations .
the right to marry and the right to found a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of these rights .
everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all levels , in particular in political , trade union and civic matters , which implies the right of everyone to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests .
the Union is a single institutional framework which shall ensure the consistency and the continuity of the activities carried out in order to attain its objectives while respecting and building upon the acquis communautaire .
the European Parliament , the Council , the Commission , the Court of Justice and the Court of auditors shall exercise their powers under the conditions and for the purposes provided for , on the one hand , by the provisions of the Treaties establishing the European communities and of the subsequent Treaties and Acts modifying and supplementing them and , on the other hand , by the other provisions of this Treaty .
the Union is founded on the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the rule of law , principles which are common to the Member States .
the Council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being imposed .
the Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity .
the European Council shall define the principles of and general guidelines for the common foreign and security policy , including for matters with defence implications .
the European Council shall decide on common strategies to be implemented by the Union in areas where the Member States have important interests in common .
if there is a change in circumstances having a substantial effect on a question subject to joint action , the Council shall review the principles and objectives of that action and take the necessary decisions .
the Council may request the Commission to submit to it any appropriate proposals relating to the common foreign and security policy to ensure the implementation of a joint action .
in cases of imperative need arising from changes in the situation and failing a Council decision , Member States may take the necessary measures as a matter of urgency having regard to the general objectives of the joint action .
the policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States , which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) , under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework .
in international organisations and at international conferences where not all the Member States participate , those which do take part shall uphold the common positions .
the European Parliament may ask questions of the Council or make recommendations to it .
it shall hold an annual debate on progress in implementing the common foreign and security policy .
any Member State or the Commission may refer to the Council any question relating to the common foreign and security policy and may submit proposals to the Council .
in cases requiring a rapid decision , the Presidency , of its own motion , or at the request of the Commission or a Member State , shall convene an extraordinary Council meeting within 48 hours or , in an emergency , within a shorter period .
if a member of the Council declares that , for important and stated reasons of national policy , it intends to oppose the adoption of a decision to be taken by qualified majority , a vote shall not be taken .
the European Union established by this Treaty shall be the successor to the European Union established by the Treaty on European Union and to the European Community .
the government of any Member State , the European Parliament or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of this Treaty .
if , two years after the signature of the treaty amending this Treaty , four fifths of the Member States have ratified it and one or more Member States have encountered difficulties in proceeding with ratification , the matter shall be referred to the European Council .
the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community ( Euratom Treaty ) was signed in Rome on 25 March 1957 and came into force on 1 January 1958 .
the aim of the Euratom Treaty was to coordinate the research programmes already undertaken or planned by the Member States for the peaceful use of nuclear energy .
this treaty has now in a sense been absorbed into the EC Treaty .
the accession Treaties contain the terms laid down for the new countries &apos; accession to the European Union and the necessary adjustments to the treaties on which the Union is founded .
the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC Treaty ) is the oldest of the European Community &apos;s three founding treaties and it was signed in Paris on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002 , as it had been concluded for a period of 50 years .
the purpose of the treaty was to set up a common market in coal and steel , and this formula was meant to be gradually extended to other areas of the economy .
the coal and steel sectors now come under the ordinary regime of the EC Treaty .
these are always agreements concluded between subjects of international law ( Member States or organisations ) for the purpose of establishing cooperation at international level .
international agreements are the second source of EU law , allowing the European Union to develop its economic , social and political relations with the rest of the world .
agreements concluded by the European Union under the first pillar are binding on the institutions of the Union and the Member States ; those concluded by the Union under the second and third pillars are binding on the institutions but not always on the Member States .
Association involves close economic cooperation , combined with extensive financial support from the Community for the partner to the agreement .
cooperation agreements do not have the same scope as association agreements , in that they are concerned only with intensive economic cooperation .
trade agreements are agreements on customs and trade policy concluded with non-member countries or groups of non-member countries or within the framework of international trade organisations .
agreements between the Member States are binding legal instruments concluded between the Member States either to resolve matters that are closely linked to the activities of the Community but for which the Community institutions have not been given any powers or to extend the territorial limits of national provisions in order to create uniform law at Community level ( the agreement on the Community patent , for example ) .
the “ secondary legislation ” is the third major source of Community law after the treaties ( primary legislation ) and international agreements .
secondary legislation comprises the binding legal instruments ( regulations , directives and decisions ) and non-binding instruments ( resolutions , opinions ) provided for in the EC Treaty , together with a whole series of other instruments such as the institutions &apos; internal regulations and Community action programmes .
the legal instruments associated with the second and third pillars , which do not , strictly speaking , form part of secondary legislation since they continue to be governed by intergovernmental relations , have been included in this category for reasons of proper documentation .
adopted by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament or by the Commission alone , a regulation is a general measure that is binding in all its parts .
unlike directives , which are addressed to the Member States , and decisions , which are for specified recipients , regulations are addressed to everyone .
a regulation is directly applicable , which means that it creates law which takes immediate effect in all the Member States in the same way as a national instrument , without any further action on the part of the national authorities .
consolidation consists of incorporating into a single text , with no official authenticity , a basic instrument ( a Treaty or piece of Community legislation ) and the amendments and corrections subsequently made to it .
the Court of Justice and the Court of First instance hand down judgments , which are decisions that conclude a litigation procedure .
Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner .
two years ago he was diagnosed with liver cancer but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread .
the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons .
the World Health Organisation estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually .
China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted the possibility to get transplants for foreigners .
Pakistan , where trade in human organs is not illegal , is turning into a “ kidney bazaar ” , said the chief executive of Pakistan &apos;s Kidney Foundation , Jaffar Naqvi .
in May police arrested nine people , four of them doctors , for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations .
stories about people selling their organs , are not uncommon in Egypt , where millions of people live below the poverty line .
a tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area in the next 24 hours .
forecasters have predicted the 6-month hurricane season , which officially begins on June 1 but rarely gets into gear before August , would be more active than average with up to 16 named storms .
several reports have shown that a third of all cancers are caused by tobacco use , and another one-third by obesity and inactivity .
the federal government also should require the elimination of unhealthy foods from school breakfast and lunch programs and must cease being a purveyor of unhealthy foods that lead to disease and increased health care cost .
frustrated rescuers ran into fresh complications on Wednesday in their effort to find six men trapped in a Utah mine , as they were unable to get listening equipment through a third hole drilled from the surface .
three times so far rescue crews have used drills from the surface to punch into underground mine chambers where they thought miners may have taken refugee and each time they have been unable to detect signs of life .
the president , however , did not announce that Rumsfeld would leave until the day after the election .
instead , the man who had become the focal point for critics of the Bush administration &apos;s management of the war , praised the president for his leadership .
defense Department spokesmen repeatedly refused to release the resignation letter in November 2006 .
Afghan media quoted local government officials as saying some 50 militants had been killed in the fighting .
local residents said dozens of families have fled the area and three villages had been bombed by US and Afghan forces and up to 30 civilians had been killed in the fighting .
“ We are not targeting any villages and the operation are specifically being conducting away from populated areas , ” a US spokesman said .
it was not possible to independently verify any casualties .
we see a lot of air activity going towards that region , it looks like it &apos;s quite intense today .
there is little in terms of policy to separate the two candidates .
angry members of a minority sect in Iraq said on Thursday they feared annihilation after scores were killed in possibly the worst suicide bomb attack of the four-year conflict .
estimates of the death toll varied from 175 to 500 .
the US military has said al Qaeda is the prime suspect for the bombings .
the US military said on Thursday two soldiers had been killed and six wounded in combat north of the capital on Wednesday .
the bombings were the worst coordinated attack in Iraq since November 2006 , when six car bombs killed 200 people and wounded 250 .
he said about 600 people were homeless .
rescuers dug through the rubble throughout Wednesday in scenes reminiscent of an earthquake zone .
bodies covered by blankets were laid in the street .
looking tense and tired , and with their heads held low , the two showed no signs of joy or relief .
“ Thank you so much and I &apos;m so sorry for causing worries , ” said the other released hostage .
authorities barred foreign media from covering their return at the airport , citing security concerns .
after making brief comments , the two were taken to a military hospital for medical checks and to reunite with relatives .
an official at the Christian church in the suburb of Seoul that sent the group to Afghanistan said neither it nor the relatives holding vigil there had any comments .
family members of the other hostages gathered at the church to watch TV broadcasts of the return and burst into applause when they saw the two freed captives appear for the first time .
the group went on its mission despite warnings from the South Korean government not to journey to the strife-ridden country .
the relatives of the two apologized when they were released on Monday , saying they would not rest until all the others still held captive were freed .
they had been in the church attending a commemorative ceremony for a dead loved one when the earthquake struck .
I have three little boys now , but I don &apos;t have a house , because it fell down .
around him , people filed into the plaza to look for relatives and friends , most of them humble with threadbare clothes and hard-lined faces .
nearby a father and daughter lay in an embrace , as they were found dead in the church rubble .
next to them three boys , aged around 10 , 3 and 18 months , likely brothers , lay side by side .

an 81 year old woman was referred to a multidisciplinary breast clinic with a lump in her right breast .
it is usual practice for patients over 35 years with discrete breast lumps to undergo mammography and ultrasound .
Mammography has been evaluated more extensively than any other imaging technique and remains a mainstay of the diagnosis of breast cancer .
if a diagnosis of breast cancer is made , definitive treatment ( usually surgery ) can be planned .
can modern breast radiology provide more accurate information about local staging preoperatively ?
patients in hospital are at risk of becoming acutely ill due to their underlying diagnosis , associated comorbidities , and increasing age and the increasing complexity of care delivered in our hospitals .
staff undertaking these procedures should be trained to record these observations , understand their clinical relevance , and act upon them .
no specific service configuration can be recommended as a preferred response strategy because robust evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness is lacking .
if the team caring for the patient considers that admission to a critical care area is clinically indicated , then the decision to admit should involve both the consultant caring for the patient on the ward and the consultant in critical care .
after the decision to transfer a patient from a critical care area to the general ward has been made , the transfer should occur as early as possible during the day .

I think it is good news and I think we have to appreciate that they have listened and changed things to the benefit of everybody .
a spokesman for Network Rail said the firm was pleased to have reached a compromise .
we have taken on board the comments that we have had and juggled them as much as we can to get the best compromise .

a new disaster movie charts the devastation of London under water .
the most recent major disaster took place in 1953 and saw over 300 people killed .
the threat of flooding is slowly increasing as time passes .
climate change is raising sea levels on the one hand , while on the other London is feeling the effects of subsidence , and is sinking a couple of millimetres each year .
in addition , climate change also makes storm surges both more likely and increasingly unpredictable .
in order to stop flood waters overwhelming central London and to save the massive expense of building fresh flood walls and defences , some land could be set aside to act as a safety valve , catching flood waters and storing them until the danger has passed .

it has become more important for schools to identify deficiencies than to cultivate gifts .
what &apos;s needed is a new model for gifted education , an urgent sense that prodigious intellectual talents are a threatened resource .
educators have long debated what to do with highly gifted children .
we tend to assume that the highly gifted will eventually find their way .
people often wonder how to tell if their child is gifted .
truly gifted kids are almost always autodidacts .

uncle Dick died when I was fifteen .
the young lady was dressed in the height of fashion , for another wind was blowing in 1867 : the beginning of a revolt against the crinoline and the large bonnet .
the girl stopped , and looked him in the eyes .
she had taken off her bonnet and held it in her hand .
the poor girl had had to suffer the agony of every only child since time began - that is , a crushing and unrelenting canopy of parental worry .
an indispensable part of her quite unnecessary regimen was thus her annual stay with her mother &apos;s sister in Lyme .
in her room that afternoon she unbuttoned her dress and stood before the mirror in her chemise and petticoats .
Charles sat up , tore off his nightcap , made Sam throw open the windows and , supporting himself on his hands , stared at the sunlight that poured into the room .
Charles rose and looked out of the window .
he wished he could draw .
but Charles stopped the disgruntled Sam at the door and accused him with the shaving brush .
he began to cover the ambiguous face in lather .
but the difference between Sam Weller and Sam Farrow was this : the first was happy with his role , the second suffered it .
there were fishermen tarring , mending their nets , tinkering with crab and lobster pots .
he wore stout nailed boots and canvas gaiters that rose to encase Norfolk breeches of heavy flannel .
but perhaps there is something admirable in this dissociation between what is most comfortable and what is most recommended .
the sea sparkled , curlews cried .
