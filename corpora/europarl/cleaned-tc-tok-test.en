lastly , I call on the Commissioner to increase , as requested in Parliament &apos;s resolution of 17 September , the amount of de minimis aid for all productive sectors regardless of the national ceilings currently in place .
in this context , the European Earth observation programme may prove to be an opportunity for the European Union in that it will encourage the development of its industrial strategy ( especially in the space industry ) , benefit the public in terms of job creation and the development of research for innovation , improve environmental research and people &apos;s security and , lastly , generate synergies with other sectors , which may create valuable opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises .

the Congolese army continues to lack the human , technical and financial resources to carry out its mission .

Cyprus has also been the subject of a great many speeches .
however , I supported the amendment submitted on point 32 , which introduced the notion of a European transport fund .
that concludes Question Time .
first , taxation : at present , every Member State has a veto on issues related to taxation , be it the common corporate tax base , tax harmonisation or any other taxation issue , and that will remain the case after the Lisbon Treaty enters into force .
I believe the procedure you propose , regarding the withdrawal of good repute in case of a serious infringement of the law , has a great dissuasive power , still remaining appropriate .
I also note with interest the compromise amendments on free legal assistance .
first : that in building the area of freedom , security and justice the integration of the third pillar with the first should be as fast and comprehensive as possible .

I pay tribute to the determination of the French Presidency , which has spared no effort in reaching an agreement .
thirdly , if I could just make one very specific point .
it did not enter into force because of certain difficulties of a political nature , but this text is a key one , because it incorporates - and personally I see this as a mandate from my voters - the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
the problem in Central Nigeria is not only that the people who are being killed there are Christians , because in January this year it was Muslims who were killed .

in this way , carriers should be liable for loss of or damage to passengers &apos; luggage on terms comparable to those applicable to other modes of transport .
currently , a joint mission of the Presidency and the Commission is leaving for Guinea this Wednesday .
in my view , doing so is not only a task for the Commission , it is also the job of parliamentarians to ensure that the relevant associations , trade unions , employees and SMEs are involved in this debate as early as possible .
this House will support it in this difficult task .
for these reasons I would welcome our adoption of a resolution in which the House clearly rejects this missile system .

but we have said that there will be tough criteria for the next step .

as I said before , especially regarding waste or hazardous waste , here we need to ensure that implementation of the Convention will be fully in line with Regulation ( EC ) No 1013 / 2006 on shipments of waste , which was adopted relatively recently .
some elements of this call are now also reflected in this joint motion for a resolution .
accordingly , on the humanitarian side - and this also answers your question , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou - many deliveries are now actually arriving in Gaza .

the Hungarian Presidency skilfully negotiated with a very narrow majority in the Council .
in addition to a more effective implementation of the international and national anti-discrimination laws , as we just heard from Commissioner Reding , particular emphasis must be given in Córdoba to the economic aspect of the inclusion of the Roma , because their integration in the labour market and education is a key economic interest of the Member States .
the negative influences on economic growth and employment are sufficiently serious , and are now influencing the achievement of the Lisbon objectives in Member States .
however , this strategy to be more effective and applicable throughout all 27 Member States , it must contain more specific provision for implementing measures whose application would be supported both by using Member States &apos; and European Union resources .

this has all stemmed from belated and inconclusive action taken by the Italian government , which has realised that Italy is facing a crisis , unfortunately only following terrible incidents perpetrated by EU nationals .
I do not , therefore , intend to do this and will instead merely say that this is an example of how , once again , we are trying to make it easier for citizens to work and establish themselves across borders .
we have to listen to their concerns and we have to respond to them .
I also call for at least part of these appropriations to be used for technical measures that could contribute to shortening the application procedure that is too long in many cases of requests for assistance .
this is not the direction we should be moving in , and that is why we need to ponder these matters nationally , and , more than anything , establish a system in which farmers , the producers of food , can survive , and in which people can buy good quality , healthy food at a reasonable price .
the sympathy expressed in the resolution as regards the disasters endured by the Palestinian population is a sham because the EU and the United States are part of the problem .

here , we clearly prefer a diplomatic solution , a negotiated solution , instead of a military solution .
at the development level , the EU is already the main aid donor for Somalia , providing medium- to long-term support for establishing a peaceful and self-sustainable society .
last but not least , since 20 % of emissions are due to transport , we must move towards short distribution channels , first and foremost in agriculture , which will lead to the creation of jobs in our own countries as well as in developing countries and to a reduction in our emissions .
after all , the instruments are in place .
I hope that this experience will also change you and several others in the Czech Republic .
first of all , the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises ( SEMs ) .

their turnover could increase if we were at last to create a Community patent , thus preventing cheap counterfeit products from squeezing out intellectual property produced by small businesses .
the funding of EUR 146 million which is available under the amended proposal must be targeted towards projects that will have a rapid , a measurable and a real impact on economic recovery .

so let us have some leadership .
farmers should not therefore fear this limit , because it will oblige the processing industry to locate itself nearer the places where the animals have been reared .
I believe that the Commission must take the necessary action in order to adapt the rail infrastructure to cater for trans-European services while creating missing links at cross-border locations , replacing or upgrading the old rail infrastructure and helping the Member States to alleviate various complications related to the different gauges and providing the necessary financial assistance .
( applause )
the war against the workers , the self-employed and small-scale farmers is a strategic choice by the bourgeois governments and the EU in order to support the profitability of capital .
it provides the basis for a new , green deal that will enhance the competitiveness of the European industry at international level .
the market for green products and services is also set to double by 2020 , creating huge opportunities for green jobs , so we are promoting a mapping exercise across the European Union to anticipate the jobs and the skills needed .
since the European Council meeting in March signalled its support for this approach the European Commission has been actively involved in the work of the IMF and OECD on the definition of best practices .

they said that this enhanced cooperation , which currently involves 25 of the 27 Member States , could be used to fragment the single market .
( PL ) Excuse me !
there are currently already several good examples , and they should be made more visible .
the socio-political base provoking the changes in the Arab world is not dissimilar across those countries which are now in transition to what we hope will be a democratic environment .
in a war situation there is no proportionality - each war and each casualty is one too many , and it is not possible to balance figures for each side against the other .

he already has a &apos; maxi-mandate &apos; and , therefore , he may accept a mini-Treaty .
because of the far-reaching consequences of ratings , intensive interaction with this sector is unavoidable .
for all these reasons , any approach that frames this as an urgent economic and strategic issue merits our approval .
it focuses on the mobility of students , but its added value lies in the fact that it also anticipates education that corresponds to the needs of the labour market and provides the skills and knowledge needed .
job vacancy figures are part of a series of major European economic indicators and they are needed for evaluation of prevailing conditions on the EU labour market and within the euro area under the EMU Action Plan .
if there are differing points of view with regard to intervention by the International Monetary Fund , and should such discussions continue , then interest rates will also automatically increase .

I would like the Commission to consider the sine IRA et studio , to really think over whether this is reasonable .
it is also clear that on-call time of doctors and nursing staff in hospitals is to be regarded differently from on-call duty of workers at home , which is actually standby duty .
we must promote the farming profession and the standards respected by farmers at European level .
youth unemployment is 24 % in France , 25 % in Italy and 39 % in Spain .
in my view , it results from the cynical behaviour of some countries , which want to conduct their frequently dirty business in that poor part of Africa , while we are pleased and consent to the Olympic Games being held in China .
I think that cofinancing of the vaccination programmes should also continue in the coming years , given their effectiveness and the new , much simpler legislative framework which we are debating today .

the interim agreements do not yet include all ACP countries .
1 .
the representatives of civil society can address those social questions which the political groups now represented in the European Parliament cannot or do not wish to raise .
my country , Estonia , is a great example of a successful transition to a funded pension scheme .
it is important for medical treatment received in a Member State other than a patient &apos;s Member State of affiliation to be based on a proven , objective need , in order to avoid burdening national health systems with excessive costs which would inevitably compromise their efficiency .
those are the words of the UNFPA , not mine .
I know that it is very difficult to keep employment , but if we do not allow ourselves to be part of a global market , then we will get nowhere .
you must be aware that , in the last 20 years , the number of animals used for scientific purposes has not increased , despite the fact that the number of scientific publications in the area of biomedical research has doubled every two years .
( RO ) Mr President , I find regrettable the complete lack of any kind of official statistics on rural tourism and agritourism , with the only data available being based on estimates .
I was glad to hear this and welcome it .
you have clearly stated that you are prepared to change this and I hope that you do move in this direction .
EU financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland ( 2007-2010 ) (

not all these matters were raised in the Green paper on consumer protection but they are in this report .
it is intolerable that countries such as China should misuse raw materials as a political tool .
what is more , the project provides a good basis for the construction of an integrated security network , ensuring defence against cyber attacks .
the question of who suffers the most - people living with a disability , gay people or older people - is not one we are prepared to address .
in solving problems associated with Georgia , we must not forget that 20 % of Georgia &apos;s territory is still under occupation .
therefore the issue is whether we allow body scanners or not .
the 2007 Green Paper &apos; Towards a new culture in urban mobility &apos; then identified broad areas for potential complementary action at EU level to promote greener and safer cities and smarter and accessible urban transport .
the European Union should aim towards standards of clarity and efficacy within the regulatory framework .
at the same time , we understand the complexities of this huge country and I would like to express my deep sympathy with the victims of numerous terrorist attacks which have hit India .
more than 60 % of refugees are under 18 years of age and that is why I want more attention to be paid to education and health care , in addition to the basic conditions of human survival .
huge efforts have been made by all concerned to prevent this text from being sent back to the conciliation stage .
it no longer simply has the right , but the duty , to act and hold talks as well as to condemn and impose sanctions when peace is threatened by one side or the other .
the range of solutions applied by the Member States to the problem of the mutual recognition of authentic acts has meant that , today , the movement of these documents is a complicated matter , and there are restrictions in terms of the number and the types of documents that may be transmitted .
( applause )
I am therefore delighted at the presentation of this asylum action plan , to which various public players have contributed and which defines the road map to be followed in coming years with a view to developing the Common European Asylum System .
therefore , I think we have to be sensible and balanced about this and I certainly would like to see a review of the proposal within four years of implementation with full consultation from the industry in the meantime .
a great deal of your text has been incorporated into the report , and I think it disgraceful that you are now washing your hands of it !

today &apos;s discussion coincides with the International Convention on Climate , taking place in Poznań , Poland .
Mr President , the macro-regional strategies are , first and foremost , a political instrument representing one of the possible forms of regional cooperation .
the protection of women , especially during pregnancy and when they are bringing up children , must be a requirement , so that children , from the very start of their lives , can enjoy their fundamental rights .
it is not only major incidents that have a disastrous impact on countries &apos; economies and environment as well as their welfare .
now the Commission is forcing the Orbán government to amend the scandalous laws .
with this agreement , the US multinationals , which today already control more than 80 % of the world &apos;s banana trade - interests that the Commission agrees it was trying to &apos; tranquillise &apos; with this agreement - will see their market share get even bigger .
Mr President , we found that it would not be fair to mention just one of the parties , so we would like to take out the reference to the Kosovo authorities .
Russia &apos;s future is linked to Europe &apos;s and must be developed with perseverance , without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist .
Sudan and the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) ( vote )
action taken on Parliament &apos;s positions and resolutions : see Minutes
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) I would like to echo the words of Mrs Létard concerning the depth and interesting nature of the debate .
what the EU should do is to review and reform its own policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Services Directive was the subject of unprecedented public political debate when it was being discussed in Parliament .
the committee &apos;s proposal , which , in a big brother-like manner , states that seasonal fruit should be distributed , giving preference to a varied range of fruits so as to enable &apos; children to discover different tastes &apos; , is completely ridiculous .
today and tomorrow the European Parliament is expressing solidarity with the Tibetan people .
I would like to mention to you that the draft directive contains major improvements to a number of important aspects with regard to the recovery of claims : the exchange of information between authorities , methods for pursuing claims and the feedback required by the European Commission to monitor a constantly growing activity , as reflected by the number of cases between Member States .
I am hoping that the Union will be capable of responding effectively to this important challenge .
excuse me if that seems a negligible factor at a time like this .
other very important cases ( and at this point I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy , who is here today ) were the Valencia urban development law , where Mr McCreevy and his team acted effectively to defend the Public Procurement Directive .
the workers are fighting for public transport companies which meet their needs with a high standard of environmentally-friendly services .
we have just adopted the Lehtinen report .
Vice-President of the Commission . - About Greece , I am not able to answer because I do not know the details .
( RO ) The Commission &apos;s initiative to extend the application of the principle of equality of treatment to other areas of social life as well , using a global directive which bans discrimination outside the workplace , based on disability , age , religion or belief and sexual orientation , is , in principle , necessary to be able to finalise the anti-discrimination legislative package .
by raising public awareness about the importance of prevention and a healthy lifestyle we can eventually lower healthcare costs since it is cheaper to prevent diseases than subsequently treat them .
the package in itself is fine ; there is no question about that .
I believe we should react very forcefully indeed to any instance of aggression towards Taiwan .
let me first thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the report , which embraces numerous areas such as climate change , poverty alleviation and development .
that is why we are making the Europe 2020 strategy the backbone of the forthcoming financial perspective .
I also agree with the many speakers who referred to the need to emphasise the crucial role of local actors and the involvement of civil society .
that must be very clear .
up to October 2010 , the Ombudsman had no information at his disposal .
but there are relatively few countries represented in this Parliament today which have not been touched by totalitarianism in one form or another over the past century .
second place was won by a project from Ireland and third place by a project from Bulgaria .
therefore , in the vital areas of rural development , agricultural development , basic services , education and health , the Commission will continue to increase its assistance .
the proposal also envisages that fathers may have two weeks of paid leave so that they can be with their wives during the period immediately following birth .
I am thinking of the issue of human rights , here in Europe , and in particular of the role of the Council of Europe .
now I could go on but we would be here for some time .
this is not a good translation because people will then think that it means &apos; uniform &apos; .
Europe must also continue to do everything it can to meet today &apos;s challenges , and I believe that we have reason to be confident .
in this respect , the Commission &apos;s proposal does not clearly define the situations which require the reduction or suspension of agriculture payments .
the goal of the European Asylum Support Office is to provide expert assistance that contributes to applying a consistent and high quality common European asylum policy .
the vote will take place shortly .
this is not a burden ; it is a massive opportunity which we must develop further as our vision .
it is the vilification of the human being down to the lowest point of his or her existence .
we have a practice and a custom .
I would like to say to everyone who constantly maintains that the European budget is exposed to major risks , it is true that European spending should certainly be subject to more consistent controls than national spending .
in this way , we provide the possibility for producers to get a more exact idea of what they are buying .
the real question , therefore , is whether or not Airbus will continue to design and manufacture its aircraft in the euro area .
that is all on the first question .

I request that the Commission takes the necessary steps to ensure that Community law continues to prevail without fail .
both the Legal Service of the Parliament and the European Data Protection Supervisor have indicated the risks involved in outsourcing , when the external service provider is not in an area under diplomatic protection .
five years ago , two candidates failed , this year one .
I myself come from a country with 500 000 citizens .
however , the Commission has yet to provide clear research on the impact that the liberalisation of postal services is likely to have on employment .
and , if I can quote fisheries as one example , the fact that you have ultraperipheral regions in the Indian Ocean , for example , like La Réunion , is an example whereby we have a direct voice in the regional fisheries organisations that already exist and the ones that we are trying to promote for that sea .
however , we have no intention of letting them deprive us of this wonderful tradition of ours .
an ordinary EU citizen who does not directly use aviation services has nothing to do with this business .
next June , Vice-President Almunia will present to you the Report on Competition Policy 2010 .
however , what we do want to do is create greater awareness , and you get greater awareness when people are informed about their pensions , so we also need a tracking system .
the Presidency was pleased with the solution found for this issue , and I would like to read the respective statement of the Hungarian Presidency , which is supported by the next Polish , Danish and Cypriot Presidencies .
owing to the lack of common rules on tax policy issues , tax competition with its offers and counter-offers of low tax rates creates problems .
in my view , this a very comprehensive proposal which includes a whole range of aspects geared towards ensuring that safety is taken into account through all the stages of life of road infrastructure : from planning to design and use .
all Member States of the EU signed the ground-breaking UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , but in many aspects of children &apos;s rights we in Europe have barely scratched the surface .
I fully support the movement towards a water-efficient and water-saving economy and of course the full implementation of the Water Framework Directive , which I was very involved in a few years ago when my former Austrian colleague Marilies Flemming was the rapporteur .
all of this applies to the 2009 budget , which consists of EUR 133.8 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 116.1 billion in payment appropriations , and is therefore not exactly on a lavish scale .
it should be pointed out that there are obviously some clans and some tribes that still carry on this practice , and it is quite a sensitive subject in the country , but he really had a desire to make progress and that , I believe , is important .
those mandates are thus ratified .
we must therefore take steps towards limiting these appalling acts .
the European Parliament was also very active and attentive during this time .
for us , this is also the start of a process over the next five years of monitoring and sustaining political interest and pressure on all the Member States to deliver this directive .
I demand that the Commission does not - if this is its intention - conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one , as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement .
we have to be careful because , if we begin to add layer upon layer of controls and checks to verify the information circulating , then we will defeat the purpose of speed , and in circumstances where health is concerned , and where life and death is sometimes at stake , speed is of the utmost importance .
could the Commission outline its position in relation to this aspect of the abovementioned and similar projects across the EU ?
I also wish to share the sentiments of my fellow Members who have had the opportunity today to congratulate the Irish people on giving this very clear signal of their decision to opt to continue the process of European integration at a political level .
a coherent , coordinated EU strategy on culture in the EU &apos;s external actions does not currently exist and needs to be developed .
incidentally , the European Commission itself frequently says to the Member States : &apos; tame your public finances quickly ! &apos;
the vote will take place on Tuesday , 24 March 2009 .
the Commission wants to conclude the draft Directive on cross-border health services tomorrow .
· Investments in new technologies - industry creates problems but with the help of new technologies these can be solved .
also , on 11 March 1990 , the Congress of Estonia , a democratic , provisional parliament , adopted a declaration of reestablishment of the state after 50 years of Soviet occupation .
press reports about body scanners in the Dutch press have caused a torrent of indignation .
it is far too early to draw any conclusions on the changes that might be needed .
although there are four people of working age for every person over 65 at present , the ratio will be half that by the year 2050 .
stronger to face global issues .
we disagree with this approach as well as several other aspects of the report , such as its insistence on the creation of a &apos; European Coastguard Service &apos; , following a federalist stance that does not respect the sovereignty and powers of Member States with regard to the management of their territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones .
to show an increase well below inflation would earn some badly needed legitimacy for Parliament in the eyes of European citizens .
I am also in favour of the idea that a quarterly report should be submitted on the application and implementation of the monitoring .
yet , we must also ensure that we act on the results of this stress test .
Commissioner Barnier is dealing with this question .
fishing communities are currently undergoing a difficult period , marked by severe deterioration in fish stocks .
it also calls on the Lithuanian Government to abstain from any further legislative amendments on this subject and to include sexual orientation in the list of protected grounds .
I support this report which proposes a new comprehensive policy approach against gender-based violence including : establishing a criminal-law instrument in the form of a directive against gender-based violence ; training for officials likely to come into contact with cases of violence against women ; requirements for Member States to demonstrate due diligence and to record and investigate all forms of gender-based crimes of violence ; asks for financial support to NGOs working to support victims of violence .
( CS ) I am speaking from the position of someone who supports Turkey &apos;s membership of the European Union as a fully-fledged member , and not as a substitute or a kind of privileged partner ; and I would like to add a few critical words levelled at our own ranks .
- After the vote :
Europe , too , is governed by democracy , and we are having democratic debates .
we should not , however , make a mistake .
there are two essential points that the European Parliament considers as key and that all the political groups support .
indeed , Sri Lanka also has to apply for the arrangement .
I welcome the work that Mr Simpson has done and , as he has said , he has the unanimous support of the committee and quite a number of committee members are here now .
at this time of increased protectionism and with poverty spreading instead of decreasing , it is particularly important for us to keep trade open between Europe and some of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
( EL ) Mr President , the discussions in Poznań , and in Copenhagen a year from now must succeed .
this form of taxation affects approximately 18 000 farmers in relation to 5.3 % of their sales .
I hope you can give me a straight answer to that question .
furthermore , I would like to highlight the close link between socio-economic disadvantage and opportunities to educate and teach children from an early age , because families on low incomes are much less likely to use ECEC services .
I am particularly happy since , three years ago in this Chamber , during a previous term of office , I had the privilege of presenting a report on a new strategy for animal health based on the principle &apos; better prevention than cure &apos; .
what action does the Council intend to take in response , and how could this situation come about in the first place ?
I would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparatory work on the strategic framework that I have just described will count for nought unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground , hence the importance of the strategy &apos;s action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory work .
I am grateful to the President and to the MEPs who put questions to the Commission .
( FI ) Mr President , eight years after the target was set we can say with certainty that the European Union is not going to achieve it .
I voted in favour of the European Union resolution and I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the need to adopt a directive on the freedom of information .
however , we take the view that nothing must be done to impair the operational effectiveness and security of our armed forces .
in order to support these workers in their reintegration into employment , an amount of EUR 7 521 359 is being mobilised from the Fund .
we all agree on the objective , but we must be allowed to argue about the methods of achieving it , and just because someone disputes and wants to get to the bottom of those methods that does not necessarily mean that he or she wants everything to be done behind closed doors .
yet we do have to have the courage to recognise that political Islam , totalitarian Islam - not only Islamic states , or some such states , but also terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda and related movements - continues to claim many victims worldwide .
firstly , for the development of e-commerce , high-speed broadband is an absolute prerequisite .
I welcome the fact that the European Parliament initiated this important report on precarious women workers .
I regret that the debate is getting bogged down to some extent in the conflict about languages and I hope - and this is also what Parliament has expressly requested - that the Member States that are perhaps not involved at this stage will be able to join up at any time .
Europe has made an important contribution to implementation of the Ottawa Convention over recent years .
but the presence of the Ministers for Justice and Internal Administration at the Jewish cemetery for the ceremonial purification of the graves and the publicity this demonstration of solidarity received in the Portuguese media are a lesson for other cases in Portugal and elsewhere .
the Netherlands gives 15 euro cents and the UK 4 euro cents .
I therefore ask Members to adopt Compromise Amendment No 11 , which is the result of the trilogue Commissioner Michel mentioned a moment ago , to adopt it in its entirety and not give in to the temptation of an amendment that would upset the balance we have achieved .
I can only agree , and stress that this reform should start with a re-think from the roots - namely development policy - upwards .
the role of NATO was mentioned in several speeches .
this regulation is therefore a strong signal in favour of a real European transport and infrastructure policy .
what is particularly horrifying is the way that the death penalty is carried out .
that is our task in the coming weeks .
however , these quantities are not being reported to official registers and , indeed , much of the waste concerned is not being properly treated : only 33 % of waste equipment is being officially reported , collected and treated in line with the directive &apos;s stipulations .
last but not least , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs with whom we enjoyed excellent cooperation and our colleagues from the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs who voted for the report by a large majority .
several people have mentioned Poland and England and their opt-outs .
however , we need simpler , clearer and more transparent structures and better controls in the cohesion funds , so that the money is used sustainably and efficiently .
in an interdependent world , tackling these challenges could be an opportunity for the EU to take the lead in bringing clarity , social responsibility and predictability to the global financial architecture .
the need for an effective European Union response capability to deal with the increasing number of major disasters over recent years is what drove me to vote for this report .
an example of this is the greater flexibility introduced with regard to the eligibility criteria in Article 7 .
they attracted much more attention from the European public than the meeting itself .
we have to show that we have learned something from all these crises and are striking new paths .
we need comprehensive protection in this area .
evidently , the European Union does not have access to the business plan , even though - as we all know from the press - Opel is to request EUR 2.7 billion in State aid .
that is how , and that is why , the right of the citizens &apos; initiative was included in the Treaty , and now citizens can approach the European Commission directly and invite it to submit a proposal for a legislative act of the European Union .
in particular , Mr Barroso , I welcome the second principle : fairness and recognising Member States &apos; different starting points and different capacities to invest .
we also have good experience of working with all our partners in the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission , and this definitely helps to speed up the process .
however , within the European Union too , more and more newly-infected people are being registered , and the number of unreported cases might be much higher .
most of these businesses will be unable to sustain higher costs .
we must therefore help science to speed up its work and to be in a position to provide reliable policy-making forecasts as soon as possible .
ideally any limitation of our rights should be compensated by a corresponding increase in our security in the face of terrorist attacks .
I am delighted that a proposal is on the table today , including a motion for a resolution .
this will not be possible if there is no unity within your own country .
there should be no room in the European Union legal area for stances of this kind - they are against our tradition , which is the tradition of Christian Europe , and they express , among other things , the principle of crushing women &apos;s rights .
there are marked differences with what happened in Libya , where dialogue was replaced by military aggression , making any possibility of a peaceful solution to the conflict impossible .
the Germans have identified a problem , they have told us about it and they are taking the necessary steps .
another problem is the concept of post-project assessment , when certain things , including environmental impact analysis , are not mentioned and some side effects emerge later .
it is being driven forward by 12 countries that include the United Kingdom .
none of the people who come to Lampedusa or Malta have organised a boat for themselves .
visa-free travel is a deeply humanitarian act .
a special cooperation mechanism is being applied to both these countries , which must not be made complicated .
we must support them and we must help them .
and we will continue these negotiations and continue this fight , so he can count on us .
- ( CS ) - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the crisis in the dairy produce sector shows that the entire European system of quota-based regulation is faulty and ineffective .
it paves the way for taking further measures at international and global level .
however many fences we put up , whatever efforts we make , we need a global strategy and solidarity between the European states .
2 .
this first proposal is a good starting point .
with the exception of the Kyrgyz Republic , developments in the Central Asia region are alarming for more than one reason .
in future , the European Social Fund should also play an effective role throughout the entire European Union and should not concentrate solely on specific regions .
I should like to welcome the representative of the United Nations .
however , I would also like to stress the social aspect of this legislation as regards the rights of disabled people , especially blind or partially sighted people , and their right to avail of free postal services .
China is one of the few allies of the Burmese dictators .
a little while ago you spoke at length about events in Brussels .
Mr President , concerning declarations of interest , could you explain to me whether , in the vote on the next three reports on milk , the dairy farmers among us should declare an interest and refrain from voting ?
I believe we need to take a closer look to see if this is really the case , because what we need is greater transparency .
however , these requirements should not be excessive , as they might have a negative impact on the situation of people who have entered the European Union legally and hold valid work permits .
let us take up this leadership in energy transition and the new economy .
all measures that the Commission has proposed and undertaken have always been aimed at ending the isolation of the Turkish-Cypriot community as a means of facilitating the reunification of Cyprus in line with the Council conclusions of April 2004 .
we could benefit from a lot from these relations , but there could be a lot of damage .
it has been demonstrated in time that the European institutions work : specifically , in the case of the Ecofin meeting yesterday , and also with the coordinated drop in interest rates today .
the negotiations now beginning must reach their conclusion within this parliamentary term .
I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian for his excellent work , thanks to which we were able to reach a satisfying and well-balanced compromise .
we discussed it with the groups and coordinators and I received support for this change , which is in the spirit of the general proposal .
through these negotiations the final result became considerably more balanced , which meant that , in the end , I supported the resolution .
the vote will take place shortly .
I want to see a globalisation that is open , free-trading and flexible , but which is also reforming , inclusive and sustainable .
they expect the Commission to be up to the task assigned to it by the Treaties : to be the driving force behind the Union , its suggestion box .
as I have said , by agreeing a joint strategy , a specific action plan and concrete follow-up mechanisms , by discussing such important and current issues as climate change , integration , energy and immigration , the summit clearly represents a step forward , a maturing of our relationship with Africa . we waited seven years to get from Cairo to Lisbon .
there are two issues , however , which I am still seriously concerned about .
the craft sector offers employment potential and a unique wealth of knowledge that must be used to sustain the competitiveness of the European system .
Europe &apos;s agricultural potential is therefore being weakened .
seventeen per cent of accidents are caused by failure to wear a seat-belt , and approximately 4 % by jumping red lights .
that is the challenge that we could discuss further here tonight .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to join in congratulating Mrs Paliadeli on the excellent work that she has done .
we should not raise false hopes or create misunderstandings .
this report still gives Member States the flexibility to transpose the directive at the most appropriate time so as to avoid any difficulty that may arise from the reduction of regulation .
in fact it is steering by sight , with no precise aims .
this is without mentioning that the scope , in the case of the major sectors , affects our lives in very significant areas .
that is directly opposed to the main goal of the proposal .
the following year , there was a series of undocumented activities about which we were only indirectly informed , and then , suddenly , in 1997 , without any communication with the manufacturer , the Federal Minister for Health ordered the product to be withdrawn from the market .
corrigendum ( Rule 204a ) : see Minutes
we have done so , firstly , because you are exploiting it politically in order to further increase the powers of the Europe of Brussels , of its institutions and of its numerous agencies , which nonetheless continue to demonstrate their inefficiency .
the PPE refuses to allow this Parliament to become a place in which purely national political accounts are settled , which is what we shall witness tomorrow if this debate goes ahead .
I will put in a written statement on this issue .
on adopting Regulation ( EC ) No 1592 / 2002 , laying down common rules in relation to airworthiness and establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency , it was agreed that an optimum and uniform level of safety could only be secured by extending the scope of this text and , therefore , extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency to air operations , pilots &apos; licences and safety of airline companies in third countries : this is the purpose of the amendment to Regulation ( EC ) No 1592 / 2002 .
there are clear advantages for patients , especially those suffering from rare and complex diseases , since they will be able to access centres of expertise in the area of the disease from which they suffer .
East and West participated in this programme .
we are making a priority of policies concerning young people , education , mobility , training , research , competitiveness and innovation .
in writing . - We approved of the proposal that the existing rules relating to the importation of live animals , meat and meat products should remain in force until replaced by measures adopted under the new regulatory framework .
this year there was no cause for celebration on 1 May , which is International Workers &apos; Day , because there are 23 million unemployed in the European Union .
in spite of this , in the 10 Member States where design has not been protected to date , the cost of spare parts is 7 % higher than in the remaining 17 .
6 .
I have heard people talking today about capitalist barbarianism .
journeys by parliamentary delegations to different countries , to different parts of the world must be linked to Parliament &apos;s technical committees .
the conclusion must be that the quota system has not been able to deliver market stability in the market place .
that is certainly true .
( EL ) Mr President , the next Council will face a major issue , the issue of enlargement .
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is alarmed at the high unemployment rate among young people in the Member States , which was 15.2 % at the end of 2007 , i.e. almost double the overall unemployment rate .
I voted in favour of the report relating to the new draft budget for 2011 because it strengthens funding in areas that have been defined as priorities by the European Parliament , such as education , innovation , competitiveness and cohesion for growth and employment , as well as the conservation and management of natural resources .
the report by Charles Goerens , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation - C7-0079 / 2010 - .
too little attention has been given to stability in production levels and to maintaining appropriate quantities of reserves , which would limit the effects of fluctuations in production levels caused by climate change or other factors .
in writing . - I want to salute and congratulate my colleague in the Greek Greens , Michail Tremopoulos , for the adoption today of his report on transparency and regional policy and its funding .
an initiative will only be successful if it is easily implemented and accessible to all .
however , there are some questions which remain unresolved and these issues should be viewed in a new context following the prolonged closure of European airspace .
existing paper-based tools will be replaced at all stages of the fisheries chain - i.e. logbook , landing declarations and sales notes - except for vessels below 10 metres overall length .
it calls on the Member States to &apos; take a fresh look &apos; at policies to guarantee an adequate income , knowing that decent and viable jobs need to be created in order to combat poverty .
( PL ) Mr President , the standards which apply in Russia are completely different from those which are in use in the European Union .
the dispute is not over yet , as we all know .
in fact I do not believe that the vessels which arrived in the Black Sea were an appropriate response , as some of these vessels were carrying missiles .
the tone of the report is manifestly dictatorial and the proposals for cooperation given are presented almost exclusively on the EU &apos;s terms and with the EU &apos;s own interests in the foreground .
we have the chance to do this and we have the means to do it .
if this amendment is rejected , that should be included in the original text .
it would be much better to refer this back to committee and have a full and considered report in the new mandate .
I would also say to Mr Wurtz : it is also employment and growth , which have a direct impact on the real economy , that are threatened by this crisis .
however , it faces considerable challenges in areas such as global sustainability problems like poverty , climate change , biodiversity , HIV / AIDS , infectious diseases , energy , clean water - the list is seemingly endless .
we would like to see the yard undertaking a genuine far-reaching restructuring so as to become a successful company capable of competing on its own merits in the EU and world shipbuilding markets .
I am very glad about the support you provided for increasing the amounts designated for the European programme for financing the school milk scheme and expanding it to other products as well .
I am also pleased with regard to those states with the special provisions included , though I must point out that they may not be sufficient , in which case additional measures will be required .
I do not find that reassuring at all because although , on the one hand , I am convinced , like you , Mr President , of the need to continue to engage with Russia , I also do not think we should give them the impression - I am sure that you will not do so - that nothing has happened , and that everything will be business as usual .
these are a key priority , in my opinion , especially in view of climate change , and I hope we can all convince ourselves that this is a reality and not just a slogan .
regarding Amendments 81 and 12 :
however , the EU should not pursue a foreign policy and therefore we have voted no to this resolution .
however , so far , only 1 % of the EU &apos;s budget has been earmarked for this sector , a percentage that is not enough to address the difficult challenges that Europe is having to face .
the European Union needs the new Solidarity Fund now more than ever .
there is a humanitarian dimension in the Philippines case , but there is also a clearly political dimension , and they are both fundamental if we want to make progress in the frustrated peace talks .
why is Hezbollah still not on the EU &apos;s list of terrorist organisations ?
it is true that at the European Council meeting in Nice Mr Chirac originally initiated the process by agreeing for the first time to uncouple France with respect to Germany , contrary to the spirit of the Treaties .
the main thing , of course , is that we should be able to export our products to those countries .
I know how much work is involved , having been the rapporteur myself on the overall Type Approval Directive .
I also agree on the need to make a number of improvements in the area of auditing the accounts and managing the budget in order to reduce the level of carryovers and cancellations , which is still too high .
these people must be assured a just , open and fair trial in accordance with international standards .
the own-initiative report proposes a target of 15 million works being made available by 2015 , as well as access to the website for all , and in all of the languages of the European Union .
I wish you every success in your work .
I sincerely hope that this agreement will help , as intended , to strengthen relations between the EU and Moldova and in particular to reinforce the &apos; human dimension &apos; of the European Neighbourhood Policy , in other words to bring people closer so that we can all get to know each other more and better , because undoubtedly this is what reinforces European spirit and understanding .
as you have just said , you travel a lot in Sweden and in Europe .
if we are serious about fundamental CAP reform then an end to set-aside payments has to be at the forefront of any reform procedure .
arrested for taking part in demonstrations , banned from teaching , sent for re-education and now imprisoned for seeking to exercise freedom of expression , the Chinese called Liu Xiaobo a criminal whilst the rest of the world awards him the accolade for peace .
the Commission stands ready to support the implementation process , including in financial terms .
it is not the first time in history that the law has faced a challenge .
it is therefore necessary to adapt the Maastricht criteria to the current climate and economic realities characterised by larger cyclical movements .
above all , the EU 2012 budget should promote growth and high-quality employment , and help to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy .
the regions implement more than a third of public investments in the EU , and the spending of the structural funds is increasingly concentrated on objectives related to growth and employment .
1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers ;
all the questions asked about Russia concern what type of relations we want to have with this neighbour , what type of partnership we want to build , what type of dialogue we want to have , how we can encourage Russia to fulfil its duties and assume its responsibilities and how can we steer it towards an approach more in line with international law .
realistically , it cannot be introduced earlier than the start of the 2009 / 2010 school year .
moreover , the active and flexible monetary policy conducted by the ECB , increasing its injections of liquid funds into lending establishments , has played a significant role in keeping European banks afloat .
we are sure that the Commission will be capable of using the new powers that the Council and Parliament has granted to it .
much remains to be done and our problems have a wide range of different causes .
I myself , and Commissioner Špidla , who was responsible for employment and social affairs , made it clear that , in our understanding , those rulings could not call into question fundamental rights such as the right to strike , the right to trade unions and the specificities of some labour relations mechanisms in our countries .
it also reached agreement on providing EUR 7.2 billion in funds for developing countries for the next three years .
this compromise package has removed a number of these threats and will hopefully lead to a better consumer environment across the EU .
another threat to Wales could be the proposed renationalisation of structural funding , which could see Britain undersold on entitlement to support .
today Europe has a dream , or rather a vision : to develop the energies of the future , not only in Europe but also beyond Europe , the vision of renewable energies playing a major role by the middle of this century , helping to avoid conflicts over the remaining oil and gas resources , mitigating climate change and ensuring that billions of people across the world have access to the energy that is out of their reach today .
with oil prices rising and increasing environmental damage , we know the EU must now drive forward to a more sustainable society by becoming more energy efficient , by using more renewable energy , by investing in public transport and ensuring our children live in a clean and healthy environment .
it is unacceptable for the invasion of Hungary , the Romanian military occupation and the plundering of the country from November 1918 to be interpreted as a factor in regional stabilisation at an event organised here in Brussels , at the heart of Europe , under the aegis of Members of European Parliament .
subject : Commission action to foster an environment that spurs corporate investment in research and encourages banks to finance that investment
although regulation is essential in some sectors , I personally prefer transparency and a duty to inform .
we can now put the institutional questions behind us to a certain extent and concentrate on the major political challenges that we know the citizens of Europe - because it is , of course , the citizens &apos; Europe that we are all fighting for - are concerned about .
in writing . - There are many funds in the EU that are made available to citizens as well as other entities .
when can we expect a standard stating maximum noise levels for toys ?
firstly , the report acknowledges the importance of the Water Framework Directive .
over the last few days , we have gained a better understanding of what PPE-DE means .
it is clear that our authority in respect of a stress test outside of the European Union and its Member States will depend greatly on whether we can organise this jointly in Europe .
one example could be the case of women from third countries where divorce is not recognised , but who are resident in the EU and apply for divorce or separation .
clearly , we cannot expect , and especially not in the coming years , in the next few years , the same effort from those who have to reduce a heavy industrial base , such as we have within the Union and developing countries have .
travellers are victims of the current situation and , where no alternative solution is offered to them , they should not have to bear the financial cost as well .
it is surely needless to recall that , in the context of addressing mixed migratory movements , the posting of ILOs in third countries may raise several concerns from a fundamental rights perspective , in particular , regarding the right of individuals to leave a country , including their own , and the right of asylum seekers to flee and find protection from persecution .
I would like to appeal to my colleagues and to all those present , in both the Council and this Parliament , to adopt measures to provide immediate assistance to Lebanon .
as you know , the campaign for the Lisbon referendum is well underway in Ireland at the moment , and we are hopeful that there will be a positive result on 2 October .
for example , how can we be happy with the idea that to encourage legal immigration , and to do so mainly by means of the European Blue Card , which would essentially be a European work permit for immigrants , will reduce the level of illegal immigration ?
the budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation , but some Members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget while that is precisely what we seek to avoid with this report .
I understand that Europe needs to look critically at its current economic and financial stability plans in order to move forward together , towards a stronger , more closely intertwined economy that fulfils its potential as a global economic superpower .
the deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical , precarious and uncertain .
I fear they will be found wanting .
it should considerably speed up the practical usage of hydrogen cells in particular but hydrogen must not be widely used in &apos; traditional systems &apos; , in other words combustion engines , as this makes no sense to me .
it is now up to European governments to look into the budgetary possibility for taking on such a change and accepting it .
it is not for the Commissioner to do that , but they have to be on terms with their customers .
however , I fear that radical change promised by some in this review will result in another lost opportunity for our fishing industry and our fish stocks .
on 19 January , the European Parliament adopted European legislation on patients &apos; rights in cross-border healthcare .
perhaps it can also rethink some of the steps that have led to dependence on countries outside Europe in certain areas .
the directives on settlement finality and financial collateral are working well and enjoy wide support in the market .
formulating a humane and reasonable immigration policy will be a fundamental challenge for society over the next few years , but it can only be done at European level so as to avoid electoral agendas and national knee-jerk reactions .
the debate is closed .
natural disasters have certainly been occurring with increasingly severity in recent times .
landfill sites are a source of many poisonous substances , and biological wastewater treatment plants cannot purify the waste coming from them , as the bacteria themselves get poisoned .
finally , the issue of the bilateral and primarily political Nord Stream project should be settled through respecting the rightful interests of all states around the Sea and certainly not before the Russian Government joins the Espoo Convention .
there is a consensus emerging on steps towards economic coordination in Europe , and most of those steps are completely in line with the proposals made by our communication of 12 May .
I would like to finish by answering Mr Howitt .
despite making progress in the adoption of the entire Community acquis , giving its institutions reliable structures and best practice , there is still a long way to go .
the consequences will certainly be felt in Pakistan .
we also call on the Commission to promote the EU &apos;s offensive agricultural interests and the competitive advantage of the EU &apos;s high quality agri-food products and , more importantly , to secure enhanced protection for geographical indications by our partners , both within the framework of bilateral trade agreements and within the framework of the ACTA and the WTO .
I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development for their support to the amendments proposed to the opinion of the Committee that I &apos;m a member of .
I believe that with the right education and ongoing training , many young people in Europe will manage to find themselves a well-paid job , appropriate to their vocational training or retraining .
is the Commission satisfied that the recent public consultation &apos; Reforming the Budget , Changing Europe &apos; reflects the view of the majority of European citizens ; or is the &apos; one message &apos; gathered from &apos; hundreds of voices &apos; really reflective of the whole of EU opinion ?
2 .
the European City Guide has been one of the largest causes of complaints that I have received in my 10 years in this House .
in the globalised world , continued success for Europe requires that we deal effectively with all three issues .
we do not know what will happen between now and 2020 , and I therefore support this report .
on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , I will begin by expressing my regret that the Swedish Presidency has decided to finalise this dossier without waiting for Parliament &apos;s report .
I would like to say the following .
the policy of the EU , to punish Belarus and the Belarusians for the actions of their regime , did not achieve the envisaged results .
if this fund is not being used very much , it means that it needs to be reviewed and reformed .
the Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are properly implemented in the country and be vigilant that there is a continuous decline in the level of corruption in Serbia , and that those in office who abuse their position are subject to severe penalties .
in my view , we should keep Belarus in the forefront of our minds , because this is an issue for Europe as a whole .
I am happy to say , however , that all parties concerned consider it right and necessary , and that the technical solutions concerning the traceability of medicines do exist .
I first went to Washington and New York , which was the right way to start our important relationships with the United States and the UN .
Commissioner , I believe that we will agree on this point .
this is why the Greens have a problem at the moment .
there was no need to admonish us to tell the truth .
Mr President , we have only just learnt of the death of Umaru Yar &apos;Adua .
this has enabled people and organisations working on the ground to tackle the problems and issues faced by the communities at local level .
however , the Commission does not share the report &apos;s view as regards the existing jurisdictional rules in the current framework decision , because this would be like imposing a limitation in relation to the new offences .
Europe is our home .
it has been proven that it is possible and so it also had to be done .
since mobility is an issue that comes up often , it would have been a good idea to send them a message concerning much shorter journeys than 250 kilometres .
although it is indicated that the objective of the legal framework proposed is to facilitate the establishment of these infrastructures , experience has shown that it is generally the more developed countries which benefit most .
the current Swedish Presidency has initiated a significant effort to ensure the inter-pillar coherence of EU maritime policy , ensuring the link between Community action and the work developed under the second pillar , notably by the European Defence Agency .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , as has been rightly said the aim of this proposal is to create a Community-wide framework .
it is important that , amid the democratic impetus brought about by the results of the referendum , negotiations should be as transparent as possible , so as to provide a solid base for the future development of each of the new states , as well as the future development of relations between them and with the international community .
the draft directive which is due to be tabled shortly before Parliament for consideration must stipulate tough penalty measures at European level against any person involved in this kind of trafficking .
( DA ) Mr President , violence against women is a problem that exists the world over , and it is obviously important to adopt a position on this issue - both personally and from a political standpoint .
these are sufficient preconditions to create the elements of a market in the region .
by this I mean the mistakes made by Germany , which refused help from the Commission and tried to solve this crisis by itself .
you Germans have rejected a minimum wage .
in this context , the Commission is carefully monitoring implementation of the additional fiscal measures announced by the Greek authorities on 3 March 2010 and adopted by the Greek Parliament on 5 March 2010 , with a view to achieving the 2010 budgetary targets .
the Hungarians in Romania , the people I represent , are such a case .
but then , I would not be surprised , because , after all , you are prepared to ram through a constitution without asking anybody either .
( PL ) Mr President , if the protection of biodiversity is a priority of the European Commission , then there should be no talk of cloning .
this is not simply a matter of ethics , but one of political strategy .
I believe that this will be very successful .
here we have two very good reports that enable us to go more deeply into our discussion at a critical moment for the euro area .
for some of us , female and male , these constitute a necessary instrument , and thus we feel the point must be made that the European Union ought to follow the Norwegian example of applying measures to increase the numbers of female board members of public utilities to at least 40 % , and use regulations to impose a 40 % quota of female representation on boards of private companies .
imagine what it might be spent on in terms of hospitals , doctors and teachers for developing countries .
right now , we are calling on Russia to respect obligations it has undertaken in the context of the Council of Europe , the United Nations and the OSCE regarding free and fair elections , and to cooperate well with ODIHR to ensure appropriate monitoring .
I would therefore like to issue a challenge to the Commission : the Solidarity Fund must be boosted and given more resources , and aid from the EU must also focus on climate questions .
today , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on EU-Japan trade relations .
in Bosnia and Herzegovina , 2010 is an election year .
given the fundamental importance of the CAP for the governments and citizens of the Union , I argue that it should be as simple and clear as possible in terms of its implementation and the rules in force .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
the European Commission was proposing a limit of 135 g / km , a more ambitious and equally realistic proposal .
now , however , I do not think that even they are in any more doubt following the arrest of four members of the European Parliament and a bishop representing orthodox Christians in the European Union by Turkish security forces in the occupied part of Cyprus .
we do not understand how this issue can be the subject of discussions , hesitations and the calling into question of the Union &apos;s competences within the Council , when the treaty clearly indicates that this is an area in which the EU also has responsibilities .
in my opinion , it is by no means too late to avert this , but to do so we - you , Mr President , and the new European Commission - must move up a gear as a matter of urgency .
( ES ) First of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent reports , but I am mainly going to discuss the Lefrançois report .
show me the evidence of where it has actually saved citizens money rather than costing them more .
this sector needs to be promoted , because it contributes towards development and productivity .
it is important to discuss the possibility of financing infrastructure projects with the help of European project bonds , for example , as well as a possible solution for European carbon taxation so that we can switch to sustainable production in Europe .
( applause )
thank you for your attention .
we must insist that the Member States with large populations and which at present produce a very small part of their energy using renewable energy sources should close this gap .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
there is a consensus about this basic concept which has been developed over a number of years in numerous multi-stakeholder forums .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , I want to salute Parliament &apos;s work on the proposal to recast the regulation establishing the European Training Foundation and , in particular , thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and its rapporteur , Mr Lehideux .
the Swedish prosecutor issued an advertisement notice regarding Mr Assange in the Swedish system , the Schengen system and via Interpol , and that was the basis on which a European Arrest Warrant was issued .
in relation to the debate on the EHEC outbreak in the EU Member States , I would like to call attention to the fact that as a result of decisions made by EU and non-EU countries , borders have been closed in order to protect the market from an influx of vegetables from countries which harbour the supposed source of the infection .
given that we created this European Union in order to uphold , once and for all , our common values of democracy , peace and freedom , it is our duty to intervene .
I hope that the accession negotiations will get under way in the near future and that the European Council will confirm , as part of the summit in March , that it accepts the Commission &apos;s recommendation to initiate negotiations .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , can I also say I am not totally convinced by what the Commissioner told us today .
however , its rules should apply to the functioning of the single market , to cross-border trade , not issues that are only of concern internally to the national economy .
however , in the same breath , I must tell Mr Kallas that I would be much happier if he had taken the steps needed to ensure that the European Commission was complying with the Financial Regulation rules which entered into force on 1 January 2007 , particularly on the designation of end beneficiaries of the various Community funds .
consumer organisations do a great deal of work on behalf of energy consumers , especially vulnerable consumers .
I will conclude now , Madam President , by saying that truly , moderation in character or temperament is always a virtue , but moderation in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms , especially freedom of expression , is always a vice , always a weakness and always cowardly , and as representatives of the people of the European Union we cannot allow ourselves to act in that way .
even though the framework of Community occupational safety and health ( OSH ) directives is neutral in its approach to gender , it is not a sufficient reason for work-related risks to women &apos;s health and safety to be underestimated and neglected compared to the risk to men &apos;s health and safety , both in terms of prevention and research .
the policy of the European Union is coloured by two basic elements : the first is the deep-rooted inequality which is an inherent characteristic of the capitalist development method and the second basic element is that Community funds are not allocated to grassroots needs ; they are allocated to works and infrastructures to boost the return on capital and hot money for the monopoly groups through public-private partnerships .
a fierce battle is being fought over this .
we have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report .
we know that there are other paths to follow , paths that lead to solidarity and justice and a society for all our citizens .
the response of the EU to this danger should not be limited to ex post facto intervention programmes but starts much earlier when dealing with the proper storage of , limiting of access to , and controls of such materials .
the regulation , as was mentioned , has been applied for more than 30 years and its provisions are amended quite frequently with respect to national legislation .
I believe that the horizontal instrument contains many helpful indications regarding modernisation of the Community acquis .
the EU must reduce its current dependency on the Gulf States .
it is a Commission for which the internal market is more important than safeguarding the interests of the ordinary worker .
1 % !
sanctions which will affect , not its citizens , but its leaders .
I would like to point out that this directive , this dossier , was thought to be at serious risk of going to conciliation .
when voting by show of hands it may so happen , not often but from time to time , and only from time to time , that either because MEPs do not raise their hands or because there is some confusion , the presidency makes a mistake when assessing the outcome of a vote .
the treaty does not recognise other ethnic groups .
I adopt its position at first reading , taking over the Commission proposal .
finally , with regard to foreign policy , we do not agree with the application of the European doctrine as a neighbourhood policy to countries that do not comply with clause 2 of the association agreements .
( NL ) Madam President , it is telling that the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry is here but not the Commissioner for Competition .
it looks quite promising , but we definitely cannot win any commerce or especially technological confrontation : this should be avoided , it can be very dangerous .
this will require progressive management and economy linked to innovative financial instruments .
I have heard it said today that , along with climate change , ageing is one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century .
the approved text pushes for the implementation of the recommendations in the Goldstone report and for accountability for all the violations of international law , including the war crimes allegations .
we are all concerned , because the imposition of emergency rule has greatly endangered the strengthening of democratic institutions and the building of a more inclusive democratic process .
the suggested amendment will enable closer cooperation between Frontex and the immigration liaison officers &apos; network and that will improve the information exchange via a web-based secure IT platform and ensure that the Council and Parliament are properly informed about the activities of these networks .
I voted for the new amendments to this regulation given that hitherto , third-country nationals holding long-stay visas have encountered problems with the restriction on free movement .
a specific European response to the crisis for the outermost regions ...
first , I am glad that Foreign Minister Carl Bildt pointed out the most important message of the Albertini resolution - that the EU remains strongly committed to the enlargement policy and views it as one of the most successful EU policies .
the EU has to monitor that very closely .
our group will also support your efforts to launch the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy effectively and to guarantee a prosperous , equitable and environmentally-friendly future for Europe and ensure our economy is in a good position to benefit from the opportunities offered by globalisation .
we cannot expect visa applicants to bear the financial burden of the additional requirements of the European Union .
Mr President , what Mr Rack has just proposed is an interesting idea .
if we do not wish to further alienate the public from the European project , I believe we had better listen to their will and enforce it .
on the eve of elections in Burma , I believe that we will only be able to achieve something if we coordinate actions with larger states : China , India , the USA and Russia .
it is very important to fight protectionism ; it is important to make sure we are supporting our industries to be able to compete and trade in the future .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( GA ) Mr President , I should like to say that I approve of this report ; to my mind , the rapporteur has worked out a practical , comprehensive approach to the problem of fisheries discards at sea .
the latter contains information and analysis regarding the effectiveness of cohesion policy .
we believe it is one of the more successful aspects of EU policy , provided it is carried out according to rigorous criteria and that lessons are learned from other recent accessions .
capital punishment is regularly carried out .
therefore , we have to put into practice measures that help women enter or stay in the labour market by improving family life conditions , especially those that facilitate a balance between professional and private life .
if the EU is to be capable of playing a global leading role in these areas , it needs resources .
we also have , as several Members have said , a club that not only accepts the largest and most developed countries , but also welcomes anyone who is prepared and ready to accept the rules of the European Union .
patients in the EU need to know how they can avoid falsified medicinal products .
which mechanisms are in place to guarantee that an application is thoroughly examined before the asylum seeker is sent back ?
however , at least there was one way , Mr President , of solving this dispute and that was by voting .
the Dublin system has proved in practice to be a mechanism promoting the EU &apos;s overall anti-refugee policy .
anyone who wants pluralism and political competition should ensure that the election standards declared by the Council of Europe are adhered to and should allow long-term election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) at the earliest stage .
by the way , this facility was an innovation by my predecessor .
I understand - we all understand - that when GNI goes down , the contribution will go down , but it should not go down as a percentage of GNI and then go down again .
the long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do .
do you know ?
with regard to keeping on-call time as working time , the same applies to the health and safety of care workers , but also firefighters , other sectors subject to on-call time and all European citizens .
both MEPs and their assistants must be rooted in the realities of their own country .
Japan and its Canadian allies had spent months beforehand doing the rounds , winning friends and buying a bit of influence here and there in order to get the votes they needed to get the result they wanted .
at the same time , with the creation of the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the decision to conclude a cooperation agreement between the above-mentioned agency and the Council of Europe is part of the European Union &apos;s efforts to consolidate its performance and role of human rights promoter , both internally and externally .
the specific and practical form of the strategy will also be hugely influenced by the action plan being drawn up for achieving a low carbon economy by 2050 , which is due to be published at the beginning of next year .
we have denied them their natural right to be able to speak about how they should be governed and we have ignored , as much as we can , the fact that they should have had a referendum .
I accept the work done by the rapporteur , and certainly she has taken out a great many of the concerns we would have , but it does leave me wondering why we need this at all .
I consider it necessary to develop a comprehensive programme package that promotes and encourages the return of young Roma intellectuals into the community and their work within the framework of the community and for the community .
do you have this impression as well ?
my political organisation has always advocated the need to create a tax on world capital flow , such as the so-called &apos; Tobin tax &apos; .
similar instruments and similar formations of the Council of Ministers will be established under this Article .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , the most important item in the budget for 2008 is cohesion policy .
so , after 11 : 00 on Wednesday , 16 February , no more additional motions or amendments will be accepted .
I share the Spanish Presidency &apos;s view : we are here to examine a strategy , that is , the one contained in the Europe 2020 document proposed by the Commission and approved by the Council , which places industrial and enterprise policy at the heart of the strategy for emerging from the crisis and for creating prosperity and promoting development in our society in the years to come .
with the exception of the common foreign and security policy , and other cases provided for in the treaties , it shall ensure the Union &apos;s external representation .
you also said , however , that Bosnia has stabilised .
given that a number of public-private partnerships ( PPPs ) , particularly Joint Technology Initiatives ( JTIs ) , are being established under FP7 , and that they will manage a significant part of the EU budget in an autonomous way ( e.g. Hydrogen EUR 470 million ) , I would like to know :
firstly , they must not cause disproportionate difficulties for small business .
the Employment Committee wants to extend those rights to include equal working time and leave , while clarifying workers &apos; rights to social security and tax benefits .
we are completely opposed to the EU &apos;s intention to facilitate the appropriation by transnational companies of the region &apos;s accumulated wealth , natural resources and biodiversity , which will exploit workers , promote unemployment , ruin millions of small farmers , destroy the environment , block progress and deny the rights and sovereignty of peoples .
we have done two and now I am giving Mr Šemeta the question that is actually addressed to Commissioner De Gucht .
I hope that the December European Council can give its support to those principles .
the Council &apos;s draft recommendation regarding the establishment of a protocol which stipulates fishing quotas and financial contribution as set out by the partnership with the fisheries sector of the Union of the Comoros is intended to outline the role that the European Parliament should play in the procedure of reviewing this agreement .
most sites are living landscapes which have been shaped as a result of many years of human intervention .
I , too , think that the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi is the best place for an Arctic Information Centre .
the first related to the subject of competences .
Czech citizens are complaining ever more frequently - both to me personally and to regional and local authority representatives in the Czech-German border region - about harassment by the German police when they cross the Czech-German border , either in groups or in private vehicles .
there are many viable businesses which , before the credit crisis , would be making fantastic profits .
the language used today in many documents is very often difficult to understand and inaccessible for the average citizen .
however , having said that , and because I cannot stop EU citizens using exotic and tropical timber , it is important that these agreements are adopted .
Commissioner Viviane Reding has made an appeal to the Chamber for when it debates this issue , asking us not to use the European institutions to resolve problems that should be resolved at national level , as set out in our Treaties .
it damages both Afghanistan &apos;s chances and the health of others .
it is very useful to have the debate now , but we do not want a resolution because it will either be cobbled together or will come far too late .
I am sad to report , by the way , Commissioner - I presume that you are hearing this for the first time - that cable television packages in Budapest have dropped the English-language Euronews , and are offering a Chinese-language programme instead , for unfortunately there is more demand for Chinese television than for Euronews , given that the latter is not broadcast in Hungarian , whereas there is a considerable number of Chinese people living in our country now .
today , in Parliament , we know already that many countries will not manage to pass laws about this in time .
but the fundamental importance of it is this : it signifies and typifies a belief that Brussels has a right to set agendas and to dictate to Member States how they should prioritise issues and expenditure that quite patently are within their own domain and should be exclusively so , because any region has the right to decide within its limited budget what its priorities are .
our leaders in Europe are mistaken : encouraging immigration is not the way to reduce levels of poverty or its prevalence , or to promote growth .
we note with satisfaction here that Articles 5 and 6 would still leave the Commission the power to review investment agreements and withdraw authorisation should such agreements create major problems .
due to the economic and financial crisis , the main concern European citizens have nowadays is about losing their job .
as is the case for every potential candidate , there are conditions that apply to accession to this community of values , and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur not just for his report but also for making it clear in his speech what these conditions are .
according to the Treaty , the Union &apos;s exclusive competence with regard to the preservation of biological resources applies to managing fishing activities by EU fleets in non-EU waters .
I think it is important that this best practice and long tradition in Finland will also be able to continue after the new directive has been adopted .
the keywords must be focus and flexibility .
as the European Parliament mediator for children fought over by parents of different nationalities , I am convinced that this proposal for a regulation will promote friendly solutions in the interests of children , by defining parents &apos; duties towards them and setting out the best conditions with which to safeguard the well-being of the children concerned .
in essence , that would amount to negating the policy of solidarity .
I do not believe that it is possible for us to formulate a common European defence or security policy .
thank you very much .
Turkey is a great friend of dictator Ahmadinejad .
can the Council comment on Member State progress with regard to diverting biodegradable waste from landfill , as outlined in the Landfill Directive ( 1999 / 31 / EC ) ?
I would nevertheless like to point out that it is crucially important with this regulation , and others , that there is proper implementation and monitoring .
then it would make sense to do what is now being proposed .
the document we are discussing today meets those criteria .
today , despite our respect for the decision of Irish voters , I would stand in favour of not halting this ratification process now and of seeing it through to the end .
there are probably many economic refugees amongst them and we need to separate the genuine refugees from the economic refugees .
attached as I am to the Blue Angel ecolabel that we have in Germany , it must not be a question of personal preference , at the end of the day , but rather it comes down to conveying to consumers at a single glance what specific qualities a product has .
that is why I tabled an amendment on this subject .
I hope that in 2011 , we will see improved commitment to tackling the problem of unsafe toys on the European market once and for all .
indeed , Denmark , which was able to negotiate an exemption , but which also sought , as a sovereign country , to conclude a treaty with the Community so as to participate in certain aspects of this cooperation , is today obliged to ask for the Commission &apos;s permission in order to conclude new international agreements of this kind with others !
however , it is not enough to simply receive the financing from the EU allocated for the closure of the reactor .
I am pleased to see that there is broad consensus between Parliament and the Council with regard to the importance and necessity of both the objectives of the plan and the resources that need to be made available .
having become colegislator in this area , the European Parliament will have an important role to play from now on .
the Commission &apos;s proposal contains a large group of data whose sustainability is highly questionable .
unfortunately , in this day and age , illegal trade is a reality and a phenomenon which is growing in all Member States .
I voted against the draft resolution because it is harmful and does not comply with European standards .
for those of you who did not vote for me , I will try to convince you to me .
we hope that there will be a finished proposal by the summer .
nevertheless , the majority of this House has given the Commission a truly blank cheque by setting ambiguous limitations such as &apos; proportionality &apos; or &apos; reciprocity &apos; .
please do not make that mistake again , because on sensitive issues relating to people &apos;s health , we are and will remain united .
not one euro more should be added to ITER .
I welcome a coherent programme for promoting European audiovisual works worldwide , given the fragmentation of the market at European level , compared to the audiovisual industry in the United States , for instance .
( FR ) There were many freedom fighters .
they are the easiest .
for instance , the largest US embassy in Africa is in Kampala ; nothing happens in Uganda or Rwanda without the agreement of the United States .
this will mean a great deal of work for customs officials and it is a perfect present for them .
I talked with Commissioner Frattini after the meeting on 14 January , and met with him again two weeks ago , when he said that he had instructed the services to send the letter .
at the same time , processors pass on their large profit margin which they have been accustomed to hitherto in the sale price .
the increase in jobs of the classic sort - full-time , contractually protected employment in a workplace - has been relatively slow , while there has been a massive increase in part-time , seasonal work and work carried out on the basis of supply contracts .
a third basic problem which must be tackled is the internal market .
preparation for the summit is therefore proceeding .
thought should be given to whether the EU should take on greater responsibility and play a more effective role in achieving joint objectives ( engaging in joint dialogue , deciding on and coordinating joint measures , etc . ) under the agreement between the EU and the OSCE .
does the Commission look upon the Belgian court &apos;s arguments as a guiding principle for its upcoming communication on mobile termination tariffs ?
I agree with the opinion presented in the resolution that the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the electoral process is an indispensable element aimed at preventing the Kosovo Serbian community from being marginalised .
otherwise , we hope very much that the issue which you have raised will be tackled and solved in the framework of the overall talks on the comprehensive settlement .
at the beginning of the 20th century Europe was fighting illiteracy ; by the second half of the 20th century all Europeans could read and write .
the question that I would like to put to the Presidency of the European Parliament - not to you , but to the actual Presidency - is whether we have an interlocutor , whether the United States is negotiating with the European Union following the collapse , or whether it is negotiating case by case on a bilateral basis with certain Member States .
the actions taken so far to develop knowledge in the most varied of fields demonstrate the ever more acute need to move towards spreading innovations and implementing them in our daily lives .
this also bodes well for a positive atmosphere at the conciliation meeting in November .
this is not correct ; the high interest rates from the Greek Government are not due to monetary policy factors but rather to high risk premiums related to market concerns about debt sustainability .
we should also foresee monitoring and conflict prevention and resolution , and this should also involve Belarus and Ukraine .
I make no apology for that , and I make no apology for putting forward to this Parliament what I believe is a serious , 21st century free trade agreement of enormous benefit across the economy of the European Union .
the dual strategy of violently suppressing opposition demonstrations and , at the same time , promising a few small reforms without introducing any real political change could lead to an escalation of the situation in all three countries , as we are aware .
so let this oral question be a bid to refresh this debate and come up with new solutions and implement those laws which already exist which should be helping Roma communities .
we should be enthusiastic about what is being achieved in these countries and what is going well , but , at the same time , we need to be very clear about what still has to be done .
the ECB will be one of the leading institutions that have to try to deal with these challenges .
the goal is , in fact , to obtain visa exemptions for citizens of Macedonia , Serbia and Montenegro on 1 January 2010 .
I was told &apos; we cannot identify UK waters .
in this regard , I should like to conclude by simply reminding you of the objectives : a CO2 concentration of 450 ppm , which has been set in order to guarantee this limit of a 2 ° C rise .
this conflicts with the practice to date and also with internationally guaranteed minority rights .
in order to support the sustainable development of European aquaculture , including shellfish production , the EU has in place comprehensive animal health and food safety legislation .
induction support for new teachers also needs to be improved and extended .
Member of the Commission . - The ethical review of research funded under the Seventh Framework Programme is a system that safeguards the protection of fundamental rights and respect for ethical principles .
in the debate on the social package , we talked about the lack of instruments required to make the principle of equal pay for work of equal value applicable and to reduce the pay gap between men and women .
certainly , this means that it is necessary to return to discussions on quantities and sizes and not to consider arithmetical reductions .
honourable Members , Iraq is on a positive trajectory .
indeed , there must be a public service , supported by the European Union , in a sector as prominent as air transport .
these are proportional measures that always allow for the continued right of mobility , a right that will never be denied for economic reasons , because poverty cannot be a stigma or a reason to discriminate against citizens .
once during a long , eight- or nine-hour flight from India to another country , a night flight , I noticed one couple with two young children , one I think six or seven years old , one very small .
it is a major problem .
the country should stick to this path and it will do so as a particularly close partner of the European Union , which we hope will succeed in banning this barbaric form of punishment .
( HU ) Mr President , it is difficult to move forward from the stalemate in relations between the European Union and Belarus .
on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , however , I would like to say that , in any case , we still have the goal of establishing a common , EU-wide asylum system by 2012 .
so let us make it simple , keep it simple , but let us not do away with this Solidarity Fund .
to close , I should like to express my high respect for all men and women in Iran who are risking so much , who are taking to the streets , who are engaging in various activities to demand respect for the rights to which they are entitled under the Iranian Constitution .
Article 26 ( 2 ) of the Constitution of the French Republic stipulates the same thing .
last but not least , I want to emphasise the following point , by way of conclusion : do not forget about transparency and better communication with all European institutions .
I support the proposals to create an inventory of all spatial data , remote-sensing and agro-meteorological projects , and to consolidate the existing spatial data infrastructure and websites .
the gas market will only really be competitive when customers have full access to information on the amount of natural gas they are using and the possibility to change suppliers .
we are therefore in favour of adopting a resolution after this debate .
for crisis management purposes , the systemic banks should also be subject to financial stability arrangements at European level .
our decisions on the environment , services , immigration and insurance issues , and dozens of others , also in reality affect the lives of these fellow citizens of ours , who are , of course , often the least privileged .
at the same time , the debate has indicated the possibility of compromise in some areas .
there is always a risk in simplifying the gender roles and speaking of &apos; qualities that tend to be more prevalent in women scientists &apos; or creating absolute standards to measure the performance of researchers .
I would , of course , like to call on the Commission to negotiate a similar early warning system to RAPEX China with other states as well , such as India , Vietnam , Russia or Turkey , so that hazardous or counterfeit products can be seized before entering European countries .
this must stop .
in the medium term , it will not be enough to have a network of regulators monitoring the financial markets .
the signs of economic recovery need not entail immediate withdrawal of the support policies as this could have an adverse effect on the economy in the long term .
this is , of course , an erroneous claim .
the subject of own resources is covered in Article 311 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU .
this is a misunderstanding .
I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Barnier , who has provided us with valuable information in this connection .
we very much appreciate that .
this means that the financial aid ceiling has increased from EUR 12 to 25 billion for EU Member States which are not part of the euro zone and are experiencing difficulties with their balance of payments .
finally , I believe that the recent events in Bahrain force us to base the Union &apos;s relations with the GCC more firmly on respect for human rights and basic freedoms .
that is why I am emphasising my commitment to creating a European security and defence policy that has real autonomy .
therefore , we can already say that today the Safer Internet programme has had a very positive effect .
Article 53 of the Financial Regulation sets out that there should be an ex post publication of beneficiaries by Member States .
I have been told that , when the original Directive was debated in the 1990s , very serious concerns were expressed , and the discussions became very emotional .
I have therefore voted with the Greens , for environmental taxes at EU level , even though as usual I defended the independence of the European Central Bank against their recurrent attacks .
it is thus a question of whether to introduce binding European legislation .
for me , Islamism is simply a perverse dictatorship and ideology of the twentieth century .
Mr Lukashenko , Europe &apos;s last dictator , is making fun of us and , spurred on by our apathy , persecuting his political opponents and putting them in prison .
now that you have been given back your freedom and a new life , we hope you find peace in your native country , France - an important country in the European Union , which holds the Presidency of the European Union for this half of the year - and that you will find the happiness you wish for .
the outgoing Hungarian socialist government placed the Hungarian economy in an untenable situation , since no public investment or state contract was free of corruption , whether for motorways , bridge renovations , parking , health care , domestic financing or EU tenders .
I would like to hear firm and clear words from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy here , and I would like to see us not only call for sanctions against Iran but also to implement such sanctions .
we have to understand that it is our wish to improve the system , so that the number of accidents decreases year on year , and the consequences of those accidents become less and less serious .
the debate is closed .
worse still , the agreement on which I will have to give my opinion does not respect the mandate that was set by the European Council , or the European Union &apos;s strategy for the Caribbean , or its strategy for the ORs , all three of which explicitly mention the need for the regional integration of the ORs within the Cariforum and for the creation of an interregional market between these two parties , aimed at the overall development of the region .
this will prove that the newcomers are able not only to follow , but also to lead .
environmental inspections are vitally important .
I am therefore opposed to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development &apos;s proposal that the fruit should only come from the EU .
mortality rate while waiting for a heart , liver or lung transplant usually ranges from 15 to 30 % .
it is not only a limited resource , but it is the only thing that local people have to sell .
developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon (
curiously , there are no legislative texts aimed at detecting and preventing recruitment in prisons or in certain so-called &apos; sensitive &apos; neighbourhoods .
the Union now consists of a great number of Member States .
let us empower them by giving them temporary permits until things have calmed down , and let these permits be Europe-wide .
the escalation of violence in the Mexican states in the area bordering the United States , especially in Ciudad Juárez , is deeply worrying .
the European Commission should hang their heads in shame and should withdraw this proposal immediately .
in spite of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres in London and Toulouse , which are part of an international network of nine such centres set up by the ICAO , and the specialist London centre producing volcanic ash cloud risk charts , we also need to improve the European infrastructure by introducing a system for measuring the concentration of volcanic ash clouds in real time .
the Stockholm Summit next week will therefore focus on areas - as has been said already - where there is mutual interest , for example , climate change and energy , and the global economic crisis .
the dramatic fluctuations in the price of food are harming farmers , consumers and even entire national economies .
I , like the ECR Group , reject this draconian bill , which would be an atrocious violation of individual rights , and call on President Museveni to veto it .
Mr President , in the current economic climate , I think it is crucial that we do everything in our power to support those members of society who wish to contribute to our economy .
I would also like to say that human rights are in a new situation after the Treaty of Lisbon .
death penalties for teenagers are contrary to the international obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
as is well known , the Commission has undertaken in-depth work on Greek statistics over several years .
the decision to omit the Armenian genocide from the new resolution is a step backwards and one that I cannot support .
our establishment of greater transparency , by means of both pre-contractual information and the information sheets , the standardised information already mentioned by several of the previous speakers , is also very important .
- ( DE ) Madam President , the month of June was the bloodiest for foreign soldiers since the end of the Taliban regime in 2001 .
it is important for Latvia not to be left alone in this situation .
this resolution is , of course , an expression of that obligation .
the battle raged during that night and then during 9 and 10 August .
I regret the fact that the drafting of this text has been so difficult and complex , despite the fact that we all share its central objective .
in turn , Mr President , the Council of Transport Ministers adopted a very clear position yesterday , saying to the Member States that they should do everything they can to make as many alternative methods of transport available to the public as possible so as to resolve the very serious situations affecting the mobility of European citizens and other citizens .
now , tired of waiting for the outcome of the interminable wrangling , President Ouattara &apos;s Republican forces have launched an offensive on Abidjan .
the violence in Guinea received worldwide condemnation .
I am voting for this proposal as it suggests a strengthening of the EU &apos;s role in the multilateral system .
therefore , this does not apply to the reform alone , but also to the application of the current acquis ahead of any reform .
since we are a small nuclear country , we are used to being subjected to a relatively greater number of international tests than is the case for other nuclear power plants in the larger countries .
however , now that many Member States of the European Union , including those in the euro area , have come to this unsustainable situation , we cannot simply reverse the situation and try to do so in as short a time as possible while ignoring the serious economic environment we find ourselves in .
the European Union has a right and a duty to carry out preventive activities and intermediary missions , since the European Union is a project to create peace , a task it has been carrying out for the past 50 years .
on the contrary , trade policy and agricultural policy can and must be mutually supportive .
what steps do you , as Commissioner , plan to take in the immediate future to make this information more readily available to people ?
finally , the fact that it is part of the G20 goes to show how significant the country is and the geostrategic role that it could play in the alliance of nations .
so adopting a directive that leads to no reduction but only to cosmetic changes would definitely give a bad signal concerning the overall reduction of the administrative burden that we have been talking about .
the projects covered by the International Fund for Ireland already complement the actions under the EU PEACE programmes .
I would ask you to grant this request for a roll-call vote since something seems to have gone wrong on the technical side .
as the Commission has just stated , however , we do not yet have these new vaccines , of course , as we are still in the pre-clinical stages , and we are still just testing their effectiveness when given to humans .
full employment will become a goal , the sustainable social market economy will become the European social and economic model and fundamental social rights will be enshrined in the treaty .
the main thing is that enforcement of the judgments of the European Court should remove the causes leading to violation of human rights .
on behalf of the European Parliament , I reiterate my call for respect for freedom of religion and for an end to the religiously motivated violence which is being witnessed in this part of the world .
thank you for your attention .
we , Parliament and the European Commission , must design this policy together , with maximum transparency .
it is important that Europe sets itself a goal of -20 % by 2020 which can go down as low as -30 % if an international agreement is reached .
in writing . - ( HU ) Whilst reviewing the last three years of the alignment policy , and seeing the good things , but also the mistakes that need to be corrected , the European Parliament is not only looking back but also looking forward .
we will immediately inquire with Member States how they apply the working time rules on self-employed drivers and how they monitor compliance with these rules .
on the basis of this report , the main objective of the radio spectrum policy programme is broadband coverage by 2013 for all citizens of Europe , and high speed Internet by 2020 .
we must stop saying that the social dimension is not part of the European remit .
I therefore think that more harmonisation may be required .
thus it is now up to you - the Commission , the Commission services , the agency - to ensure that the Member States do indeed do what they have incorporated in the legislation in the fields of port state control , classification societies , SafeSeaNet and all the matters we are now finalising or improving .
in parallel , the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) is preparing rules for air-worthiness requirements and risk assessment for safe flight in airspace with volcanic contaminants .
it also recognises the need for open standards and their important contribution to innovation and competition , as well as for the real possibility of choice for the consumer .
2 .
attempts to prevent Members of Parliament from expressing their opinions on matters of legitimate public interest and concern , and from criticising their political opponents , by bringing legal proceedings are unacceptable in a democratic society and represent a breach of Article 8 of the Protocol , which is intended to protect Members &apos; freedom of expression when performing their duties in the interests of Parliament as an institution of the European Union .
by harmonising these laws across the EU , businesses can be confident the rules that apply in their home market also apply everywhere else in the EU .
no one can ignore the extreme urgency of achieving an international post-Kyoto agreement to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
large amounts of this gas are found in France , Poland and Bulgaria .
I also want to call for an independent investigation , as requested in the motion for a resolution before us which we support , to find out who carried out the attacks , what they represented and what has failed in the security system of East Timor , both within East Timor and , in particular , internationally .
I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements , so for now , we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years &apos; time for the revision .
new regulations on visas for Western Balkan countries ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Montenegro , Serbia ) ( debate )
I believe that the European Union will in the future become a kind of necklace threaded on these networks .
perhaps something now needs to be considered - under a NATO hat , a French-led Common Security and Defence Policy mission , or whatever - to defeat this global threat , particularly in the region of Mali , Mauritania and Niger , which are already extremely poor countries and need every bit of help we can give them .
the European Union should call for a renewal of the work of both houses of parliament , which have been suspended by the new regime .
thirdly , I notice the word &apos; nuclear &apos; does not appear in the resolution .
subject : energy - World Trade Organisation
we therefore call for the rejection of the Commission &apos;s proposal and compliance with the 2002 directive which , since 2009 , should be being applied to self-employed drivers in order to combat social dumping , protect the right to health and rest for workers in the sector , and improve road safety conditions .
27 .
Ireland is not naturally Eurosceptic - far from it .
the Waste Oil Directive - which , as you know , is now to be repealed - stipulates that waste oils are to be treated and regenerated .
it would make normal sustainable production in farming and horticulture impossible .
let me finally quote this President , if you will allow me : &apos; my Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government .
this is a totally new challenge for our countries .
only in this way can Baghdad win respect and build trust , not only internally , but also in relations with the EU .
I think there is only one good solution to that .
it is estimated that EUR 1 800 billion is spent on public procurement every year .
we only need to look at the previous policy for regulating the financial markets in order to see - if we are reasonably honest - that for months - years in fact - we have been promising to regulate these markets that have run wild , but so far have only managed to make a tiny bit of progress .
EMAS is a voluntary scheme , which provides a framework to assist businesses and organisations to improve their environmental performance .
a worker who has been employed in a given enterprise may well then find himself or herself engaged in another company .
( DE ) Mr President , our thoughts are with the victims of 31 May and our sympathy goes to their relatives and friends .
a downside of this system is the fact that it could create other risks of fraud , since all VAT would be collected at the last stage in the supply chain .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - The application of the European Semester , starting with this year , will help strengthen budgetary discipline , macroeconomic stability and growth and it will oblige the Member States to change their economic and budgetary policies .
it is unacceptable for the US to grant Cubans who are embroiled in bomb attacks &apos; political asylum &apos; .
people are rising up against dictatorial despots and that is a good thing .
the coal industry is once again at the forefront of a revolution , with the 25th anniversary of the miners &apos; strike fast approaching .
thirdly , we also need what I would like to call a &apos; pioneering spirit &apos; , which would show Europe the way forward .
we must not create the impression that some countries are not being given recognition in relation to creation of the new service .
we want to be amongst the leaders for change .
empty promises will not put the brakes on global warming .
I would like to point out that it is an utterly impossible task to achieve the MSY for all fish species everywhere at the same time .
for us we think it is important to have comprehensive legislation .
firstly , the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities , and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud , waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes .
in my opinion , the Green Paper is a Commission document that has accurately diagnosed the present challenges facing EU cohesion policy .
I voted for the report on Early Years Learning as I argue that parental leave is an essential component during the early years of a child &apos;s life .
I would like only to remind the Czech Republic of its responsibilities to the Union and to EU citizens as the country holding the Presidency .
let me mention a few additional details regarding these two questions in the remaining two minutes : there was the issue of the member of the Lukashenko government .
Madam President , so we are to have a transparency register !
firstly , we should support the proposal of the rapporteur to adopt for the present the draft of Parliament &apos;s estimates of revenue and expenditure for 2010 in the form adopted by the Bureau of the European Parliament in April this year .
his predecessor had already called for the UN Security Council to investigate crimes against humanity in Burma , as it did in Rwanda , Bosnia and Darfur .
thirdly , the Domenici report suggests an EU-wide levy on financial movements to and from certain jurisdictions .
in addition to that , there is the digital agenda , on which I am working with my colleague , Neelie Kroes , who is working with great determination .
we all knew that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area .
we have to cooperate actively with the Member States to encourage political commitment and exercise pressure from above to develop functional airspace blocks .
they were all to be urged to engage in collective action against their oppressors .
according to the Council of Europe , 5-10 % of transplanted kidneys come from the illegal trade in organs , and that means thousands of victims a year .
as it will soon be Christmas , I invite the Council to give us a decision on own resources in the years to come .
there are certainly deficits in terms of democracy and the rule of law in Russia .
we will support genuine initiatives that will stand for workers &apos; rights within Europe , but when the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself in fact institutionalise the judgments of the European Court of Justice whereby they find in favour of the exploitation of migrant workers by contractors supplying businesses across borders , how can we support that ?
the financial economy must be set against the real economy .
we will have to introduce separate rules for local public transport , to ensure that there too customers are treated like kings and not servants .
this actually makes me wonder - even if the Commission has said that it has the information and is publishing it , that there is an obligation to publish it - why this , for example , was not known .
all the figures are available , from the Committee on Budgetary Control , for what is done to recover wrongly paid money .
to what has already been said I would like to add only that between 2001 and 2007 , 20 000 children disappeared , 500 of whom were found .
let us face it ; there is no escape from deeper economic integration and this therefore implies closer political union .
in March II , we will hold a priority debate in this plenary meeting about the adjustments to the cohesion policy .
there are well-founded concerns that greater efficiency has been achieved at the cost of citizens &apos; rights , and it is high time that we bridged this gap .
Spain is grateful to the European Union , to the founding fathers and to the large countries such as France , Germany and Italy which have helped us to bring democracy to our country , which have welcomed us into Europe and which have then , with their resources , contributed to our development .
Mr President , after Copenhagen , let us reassess the whole global warming story .
could you please clarify under which of the Rules of Procedure was the question raised and an on-the-spot vote taken to withdraw an agenda item we were due to debate this afternoon ?
I should like to pick up a few of the issues that have been mentioned .
( NL ) Mr President , I see that , fortunately , I am not the only one who very much questions this rather absurd initiative , the apparent purpose of which is to brand Italy a country where freedom of information is fundamentally under threat .
we are reassuringly told , including by the Commission President , that the changes need only be limited , but that does not appear to be what the German Government believes .
we have to invest better and more in education and training .
for this reason , the European average for the number of donors is 20 , and in Romania , only 0.5 .
I wish , however , to point to the presence of some weaknesses , above all , in recruitment planning , in respect of which I hope a rapid improvement can be made in the procedures relating to future financial years .
in writing . - ( PT ) Access to quality information relating to medicinal products that are subject to medical prescription will contribute to achieving better results in terms of patient health , in that the better informed they are , the more likely they will be to better understand decisions related to their treatment .
it is also true that in Europe the situation is basically good , in terms of both fresh water quantity and quality .
now we must take action and - I am saying this after the consultations with the Americans - this will put us in a better negotiating position and on an equal footing , which will enable us to improve security and the rights of citizens in the European Union and perhaps even in the US .
however , this sector raises a number of issues which need to be clarified .
each of the speakers will have one minute .
EU-Turkey relations ( vote )
advertising is an essential tool which ensures that the free market functions properly .
it also guarantees uniform conditions for implementing measures concerning control and enforcement , and for the expenditure incurred by Member States in implementing the control system and enforcement applicable to the common fisheries policy , and in the area of the collection , management and use of basic data .
that is why it is so important to conduct this coherence review in order to ensure that the other policies we pursue do not impair and undermine our development policy .
this is without mentioning the consent of the Commission , as discussed by Mr Brok , which provides further scope for the European Parliament .
in addition , cooperation with Russia in this area must not mean a weakening of the defence of Central Europe .
it deals with artisanal fisheries and historic rights .
we , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece , are opposed to the selling off of the railways , especially in Greece , where rail transport is far removed from the people &apos;s needs and in many cases continues to operate with obsolete infrastructure and equipment .
I also request roll-call voting for the final vote .
together they can encourage change and solutions at global level , for example by working closely to promote and implement the Development Goals in order to tackle poverty and economic and social inequalities at global level , by strengthening cooperation in the area of development aid , including triangular cooperation , and at the same time by working together to combat international terrorism , drug trafficking and crime .
it must make sense and must be reasonable in terms of the future .
it is important that we give the right message to Member States that are receiving European funding through the medium-term financial assistance .
11 .
the document specifying the new OLAF framework was the subject of consultations with the Council of the European Union , the Court of Auditors and the Data Protection Ombudsman ; in addition , importantly , a public hearing was held - in other words , public opinion was consulted .
does the Commission agree that such a mechanism would help create a more results-oriented cohesion policy ?
every decent person was shocked by last week &apos;s natural disaster in the Far East .
this requires resources and I would like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Figeľ specifically for the fact that the Commission is willing to cooperate in this matter .
however , for me , that is a very long time ago - if you read my curriculum vitae - to make me choose such an expression .
I do not think people in Europe want these artificial colourings , and I think we should be looking more at what people need to have in their food , not what companies want to add .
I believe that the Council should have been present for this debate and as has already been said , this must be stated and reiterated .
it is vital to give them support not only in terms of meat , but also in terms of milk , a sector I am very familiar with in Sardinia .
my plea is that a global , coordinated approach is adopted at all times and maintained to ensure the future access to capital for all our businesses in Wales , the EU and beyond .
microfinance is an interesting instrument to provide people who are unemployed or in danger of losing their jobs , and also enterprises in the social economy , with financial support in times of crisis .
this will therefore be the spirit in which the Commission &apos;s measures are coordinated .
we have heard from companies in the air travel sector , the services in charge of security in the Member States and the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator .
before you all today I formerly pledge that - if I am confirmed by this Parliament - I will apply those political guidelines during my second term and I will , together with incoming Commissioners , translate them into the next Commission &apos;s legislative and work programme .
in the statement , we reaffirm that all euro-area members must conduct sound policies in line with the agreed rules and should be aware of their shared responsibility for the economic and financial stability of the area .
we are currently seeing the problems of energy dependence .
in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Gyürk &apos;s report on follow-up of the energy efficiency national action plans .
this really is an area of work where parliamentarians working with us can make a significant difference .
the EP has imposed itself simultaneously as a colegislator sharing responsibility within the institutional triangle and in European public life , but also by forging ever closer links with the national parliaments , a large number of which are represented here today .
he is wrong .
decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
since its economy and industry remain largely unreformed and unstructured , we expect the negative tendency to continue with negative social consequences as a result .
according to the applicants , the process is often based on non-transparent criteria .
I regret that a further ten or twelve Members were not able to speak , but it is impossible given how late we are running and the Rules of Procedure we are bound by .
our main conclusions were to step up the regional dialogue and support regional integration , to strengthen bilateral relationships - taking into account the diversity of the region - and to adapt cooperation programmes to make them focused and results-oriented .
we do not therefore want to introduce this model in Europe , knowing full well that in my country , in my region , access to the Internet is restricted .
in writing . - ( FR ) I welcome the adoption at second reading of the Council common position amending the Postal Directive of 1997 and aimed at full accomplishment of the internal market of postal services , and I congratulate my excellent German colleague Markus Ferber for the immense job he has done .
this recast regulation is essentially about bans and restrictions on the production , import , export , placing on the market , use , recovery , recycling , reclamation and destruction of these ozone-depleting substances .
the Liberal Group has requested an extension of the deadline for the tabling of joint motions for resolutions and amendments on the priorities of the European Parliament for the legislative and work programme of the Commission until 10 a.m. tomorrow - Tuesday , 23 September 2008 .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
coordination of social security systems - Coordination of social security systems - extending Regulation ( EC ) No 883 / 2004 to third country nationals otherwise excluded ( debate )
we hope that this potential will be utilised , and that this can become a reality .
this is therefore a great opportunity to shape our legislation in these new fields where there is no legislation as yet .
I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution drafted by various political groups .
will the Member States present a united front ?
a recent study by Southampton University has alerted this chamber to the potential dangers of azo dyes , used to colour certain sweets and drinks .
people consider that mass culling for disease-control purposes should be performed in the most humane way possible .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it would be truly hypocritical if Parliament , after voting by a very large majority for Mrs Angelilli &apos;s oral amendment , which sends the condolences and support of the European Parliament to the family of a victim of such an unmotivated and serious crime in our country , then fails to adopt a clear position to prevent these acts , this massacre of honest citizens , which is happening due to the lack of controls .
today , monitoring of fishing activities places increased demands on the Member States , whether under the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) or under multilateral cooperation , as the proposed transposition now demonstrates .
following analysis of the proposal that it currently contains , it may be stated with assurance that the compromise package approved by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , The Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe fully reflects the interests of all parties concerned that will be directly affected by the directive .
therefore we ask Commissioner Mandelson , who in his letter confirmed that he did not intend to negotiate TRIPS-plus provisions , to remove from the draft Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean countries the request for adherence to and acceptance of the obligations of the Patent Cooperation Treaty , the Patent Law Treaty and the intellectual property provisions of Directive 2004 / 48 / EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights , which unequivocally resemble TRIPS-plus provisions .
thank you , and the same to you and all the College of Commissioners and staff .
in that regard we would need to be very careful and not over-regulate and price ourselves out of the market .
the introduction of electronic data transfer into the Polish pensions system has greatly reduced the number of errors in the transfer of insurance data between institutions .
safety in terms of all stages of the flight itself and also of conditions at airports has to be deemed a priority and must not be allowed to be the subject of conflicts of competence with national authorities .
this is one ideological prejudice that I would like to get rid of .
the general state of the world economy raises the spectre of slower growth and job losses in Europe .
it is important to protect investors , but the Commission is called on to submit a clear definition of the investments that should be protected .
however , the most incredible thing is that there are many Members of Parliament who defend Christians around the world , and yet they are in favour of Turkey joining the EU .
we should be pleased that the ne bis in idem principle is ensured in the area of states &apos; courts .
( HU ) Mr President , I would like to say that I quite agree with and support the rapporteur and also Commissioner Malmström in finding a solution for this issue that is in line with the rule of law , respect for human rights , data protection and , of course , safety considerations , too .
the number of full members should not exceed 10 % of the positions or a total number of 20 .
yet the best solution would definitely not be to establish financial concessions for employers if they encourage their female employees to have children .
I am counting on you , Commissioner .
moreover , the Presidency puts emphasis on achieving progress in Chapter 15 on energy , in compliance with energy issues , because it is one of our priorities .
it is the European Union &apos;s duty to monitor closely the development of human rights and to use all its influence to reverse this negative trend .
people &apos;s sense of reality with regard to climate protection seems to have gone out of the window .
thank you .
the European Parliament has been wavering for five months over whether human rights for women should actually be a priority or not .
many issues have been raised , including intellectual property rights and public procurement , and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides .
one area that is particularly important , it seems to me , is the question of civil society .
a ration of oats compensates a job well done , but oats also provide energy for all the work that remains .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , High Representative , I congratulate Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on an excellent report on the EU &apos;s strategic relationship and partnership with Latin America .
I am delighted to support Mrs Doyle &apos;s land-all policy , whereby fishermen will be compelled to land everything they catch .
I agree entirely with what Ana Maria Gomes has just said .
this initiative therefore makes an important contribution towards achieving our ambitious targets as part of the partnership for &apos; Growth and Jobs &apos; .
( RO ) Last Sunday , Romanians elected their representatives in the European Parliament for the first time .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma .
I voted in favour of the resolution condemning violations of human rights , because we must not tolerate or consent to their being broken , either as people or as citizens .
it is important , therefore , to promote diversity in agricultural production , which spans large merchant chains , traditional agriculture and small-scale farming ; to guarantee access to credit for young farmers ; and to encourage the development of food stock management programmes , so as to facilitate world trade and bring world market prices down .
it means that Europe will have to fight with a new vision and with sophisticated policies in order to retain its position in global economic decision-making .
the Council needs to be scrutinised in the same way as every other European institution , and written documents must be provided in order for discharge to be granted .
however , it is vital to ensure that the process complies with EU legislation in the area of data protection .
no financial institution , be it public or private , should escape regulation .
in writing . - When the regulation now being amended was adopted on 19 February 2004 , Frontex was yet to be officially established .
President-in-Office of the Council , a large number of subjects are currently blocked because of a problem between Parliament , which wants to continue applying the Community method , and the Council , which does not want to go in this direction .
I think that gradual fiscal consolidation and safeguarding the European social model are needed to lay the foundations for sound economic growth .
in particular , this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol , agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law .
I also state in the report that ...
the EU must propose a number of short-term objectives which Bosnia can meet so that its citizens can see the progress made and be motivated to continue the reform process .
these organisations could help to make consumer protection a central theme in the dialogue about regulation of the financial markets .
we have had some great initiatives and success stories , like the Growth and Jobs programme or the &apos; Think Small First &apos; project , and there have been some great legislative successes - the Services Directive , the supervision of the financial markets regulation , climate change policy and the new energy package , to list just a few .
this is because I believe that it is important to improve the efficiency of EU disaster response capabilities and that a preventive action plan has become increasingly necessary as a global , integrated EU response .
EC-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement ( vote )
you are putting the economy of Hungary right , Mr Orbán .
in Mrs Hedegaard &apos;s road map , we have included a reduction of 10 % in CO2 emissions for the energy sector by 2050 compared with today &apos;s levels .
however , we have to stick to our values : we cannot tolerate nation-building being confused with nationalistic rhetoric or with gross manipulation of history , going back to ancient times .
various courses of action can complement each other , as I shall describe later .
( applause )
I also think that it is good - and this is also something that is , in fact , a necessary consequence of the Treaty of Lisbon - that the position of this House in the area of international negotiations in respect of international agreements will be considerably improved and Parliament is to be granted genuine access to all information and to all of the conferences .
I think we have achieved that by bringing in legislation for this citizens &apos; initiative .
in the evening , it will get dark too soon and , if you come home from work and want to have some exercise or go out with children , it is already evening .
( applause )
we have a decided overcapacity in motor vehicles in the European Union .
it enables Europe to function better and it gives it the tools it needs to be speak with a louder voice on the world stage .
it must be based on an integrated approach , dovetailing the implementation of existing and new legislation and the dissemination of good practice .
Commissioner Füle rightly talked about the economic conditions making the political difficulties more acute .
yet , at the same time , the system and the Schengen acquis in general also provide the more astute criminal with a broader platform for international crime and corruption .
author . - Mr President , before we vote on the resolution I tabled on the accession process for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , I wish to make three technical remarks so that everybody can decide on the correct texts .
the unemployment rate among young people hit the 20 % mark at the start of the year , due to the economic crisis , while the school dropout rate reached 17 % , with young people in rural areas being mainly affected by this .
if we are to support the Uyghurs , let us do so by means of a friendly appeal to the Chinese , because the Uyghurs are threatened with cultural ethnocide .
political short-sightedness in the Georgian crisis will not only widen the internal divide within the Union , but will also put massive strain on relations with Russia .
these deficiencies take their toll both on Member States and on the victims of persecution .
if food safety is one of the main requirements and greatest concerns of a market with over 500 million consumers , the way it is assessed and studied requires extremely high levels of professionalism , performance and impartiality .
multi-annual programme 2010-2014 regarding the area of freedom , security and justice ( Stockholm Programme ) ( vote )
that is why it is also so important for the necessary structural reforms , which the Commission and the European Central Bank have repeatedly called for in the past , actually to be pursued in the individual Member States .
( FR ) Mr President , in this period of economic recession , it was important for the European Union to continue to show solidarity towards developing countries .
yes , I believe we must look at the situation regarding the standards for GMOs .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
we need the IMF to fill that role .
I agree with the Commissioner that it is good for the EU to have a presence in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission ( IOTC ) , but my question to the Commission is the following :
we must educate them , true , but not by stating that we need a policy at EU level to face the challenge of a globalised economy .
the Member States have until June to distribute these funds .
I request the Commission to draw up studies and projects for the Black Sea region , which has to become a strategic region of the TEN network .
I think we should have a rule that we should know at least two hours in advance who will take the floor in the one-minute speeches .
in writing . - The Guillaume report covers important areas of law and emphasises the need for human rights to be fully respected in relation to people seeking asylum .
the truth is , we will not get rid of the problem of the undeclared workforce merely through regulation .
I therefore back the proposal to enhance cooperation , even at the expense of some Member States not participating .
this is that , essentially , the salary of an MEP is regulated by the Statute for MEPs , whereby a revision or update of MEPs &apos; salaries is achieved by amending the Statute for Members and not through a vote in plenary with regard to the EU annual budget of any particular year .
yes : catharsis .
we have seen some examples of that .
the Commission is looking into the possibility of launching projects aimed at reinforcing Pakistan &apos;s counter-terrorism capabilities .
the proper response would be to agree a European strategy for combating high food and energy prices together with protection for poorer households .
the method for meeting the necessary accession criteria , especially those coming under Chapter 23 , justice and fundamental rights , marks an important milestone in this country &apos;s progress in achieving European standards .
good luck .
ethical diversity must be safeguarded , and thus I am glad that this question is addressed in the report .
in so doing , I would point out that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and does not have any status under international law .
on the basis of these premises , I voted for the Portuguese nominee for Chair of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority who , as is stipulated , is subject to strict rules regarding independence .
that is why we abstained .
further cooperation in the field is foreseen for the period 2011-2013 .
secondly , I would like to emphasise that , given that there is currently no European coordination of organ exchange , making an improvement in that area is very important , specifically with regard to coordination of the system for organ exchange such as it currently exists between the Member States , for example through a European donor card or a European hotline .
I firmly believe that every EU Member State government has a fundamental duty to speak out against disinformation and falsehood .
the statistics provided by international organisations are appalling - they say that around 150 000 Christians are murdered worldwide every year .
on these points , our jobs , but also our policy , will be judged on the basis of the results achieved .
the EU now demands cost reductions , but is it realistic to expect the cost of the public sector in Greece to be reduced if 20 % of the working population is employed by the state and 50 % of SMEs have the state as its only client ?
I think it is fair to stress that during these months of close collaboration with the Commission and the Council , we have undoubtedly achieved an important goal for the European Union , by putting an essentially technical dossier at the top of the European political agenda .
this Web TV idea as a technical information channel is an acceptable notion , but it should not be put into effect in the way that is now being suggested .
the communication of September 2008 , &apos; Multilingualism : an Asset for Europe and a Shared Commitment &apos; , confirms Commission support for all languages spoken in the Community , including the languages spoken by minorities .
the proposal by Mr Frattini concerning the introduction of packages of legal-entry quotas could , I think , facilitate a reduction of illegal migration within the European Union , but it could also result in more effective control over illegal migration in third countries .
Britain has a massive problem with illegal immigration .
we all want to reach a ripe old age , but not to be lonely and at the margins of society .
that is why we are preparing a very important package in terms of access , opportunities and solidarity , which will be ready before the summer .
we call on the Commission to keep the promise it made to this House that EU action will cover all areas of discrimination .
as long as the European Union does not speak with only one voice in its common security policy , it is very difficult for us to impose efficient and systematic Community sanctions .
it is obvious that after the war in Georgia the West needed every little move it could make to try to counterbalance Moscow &apos;s growing influence in post-Soviet territory .
the Commission &apos;s proposal for a &apos; soft landing &apos; policy and a 2 % increase in quotas every year until 2014 , when the current regulation expires , amounts to an intensification of the unequal distribution of quotas between Member States .
we will not be able to shift this burden onto private business .
the question we therefore have to deal with here today and in the future has two aspects :
furthermore , we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims .
migration , economic uncertainty and political tensions are putting strains on relations between different cultural , ethnic and religious groups .
the unity of this country remains within our grasp .
it also advocates a safety net and promotes the association of small farmers .
therefore , it is essential that the provisions for waste disposal and recycling are harmonised across and within the Member States of the European Union and , most importantly , that the export of waste without provision being made for certified and environmentally sound disposal is stopped .
if we are talking about further development of the technology , then this must be in all areas .
as usual I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report , and I fully agree with him that we must make sure that the system becomes more consolidated and , above all , more productive and more useful .
it calls for them to be reported .
forty seven year-old Nasrin Sotoudeh , who was arrested on 4 September , tortured and who has now been sentenced to 11 years in prison , is an example of this .
explanations of vote
there is nothing about a democratic counterweight to the ECB imposing a monetary policy that favours industry and jobs .
ladies and gentlemen , the Commission reports have not established a single breach of competition by the German Alcohol Monopoly on the internal market .
this implies a stronger role for Parliament - for you - and closer democratic scrutiny .
we certainly do not want to introduce US conditions .
raw material prices have now plummeted , so that a barrel of oil must now cost around USD 43 or 45 , but the same pattern of a very sharp fall can be seen in the price trends of many other raw materials .
indeed , I think it is a good idea for the countries bordering the EU to receive reciprocal trade concessions , both for economic development and socio-political issues .
as regards the specific question of Iceland adopting the euro without joining the EU , of course Iceland can unilaterally take such a decision but it should be clearly stated that it is the Commission &apos;s firm view , as well as a view of the European Central Bank , that unilateral &apos; euro-isation &apos; is not a desirable political option for Iceland .
if you offer him the foundations for a health care system , you have helped not only him for life , but also his children &apos; .
we have seen his action at the meetings in Kigali and Kinshasa , which resulted in Nairobi .
it is not an easy process and we will continue to deal with it .
human trafficking has long been an important item on the EU agenda and clearly we must continue to implement a combination of measures to combat this appalling violation of the most fundamental rights .
two key elements should be pursued to ensure sustained economic development associated with the achievement of prosperity in EU .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I , too , should like to join my colleagues in thanking and congratulating Mrs Harkin for having produced this report .
I am referring to Western Sahara .
that is why the Council did not restrict itself to this issue but entered into a wider , simultaneous debate on the overall package of the common agricultural policy health check .
instead , we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common policy that exists in the EU .
I would first like to thank the rapporteurs for the amount of work they have put in to preparing the reports on the Single Market , and also to congratulate them on the end result .
special attention was paid in this respect to system development and the guarantee of a compromise that does not discriminate between system operators .
you have worked very hard in this Chamber today , so thank you for being with us and for giving us such excellent and detailed answers .
that was something we actually gained .
we need to reinforce the synergies between our Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs and our climate and energy agenda .
it is indispensable for all media to broadcast in ways that are accessible and unimpeded ( with subtitles , accompanied by clearly visible visual information ) and to help people at times of natural disasters ; furthermore , mobile telephone operators should cooperate in providing their subscribers with preferably free and immediate information tailored to individual preferences and needs .
many of these people have also asked me what we are doing and what Europe is doing for them and their family .
thirdly , the Commission has tried to ensure that , in the very short term , the Member States exposed to the growing flows of refugees and irregular migrants could cope with the financial consequences of this displacement .
thank you .
Mr Guardans , Mr Medina and Mr Mavrommatis have made that point very well indeed , and I agree with them .
it is because the thugs and criminals do not fear the law .
why should that be the case ?
this is a question to both the Commissioner and the Council , and relates to the fact that 80 % of our funds are actually spent in the Member States , and that Parliament has been advocating national management declarations for many years .
I think a balance must be established between privacy and the need for jurisdictions to enforce their tax laws .
however , we welcome the approval of the paragraph that considers excessive working hours and insufficient rest periods to be a key factor in increased levels of accidents and illnesses at work , and that calls for a proper balance of work and family life .
the strategy that I adopted , and which has been taken up by the rapporteur , therefore involved rebalancing this proposal to ensure that researchers are not harmed .
regrets that the justification of the proposal to set up a PNR data system in the EU has left so many legal uncertainties with respect to compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) ;
illegal logging is very often the first step towards the general exploitation of natural forests .
when we disagree , it is difficult to take forward any agenda , so the transatlantic relationship allows us to achieve together results which we cannot achieve alone .
my third point relates to air traffic .
finally , it goes without saying that safety is essential .
and the Committee of the Regions does the same in a report brought out at the same time .
in this context , I would like to emphasise that , in addition to the envelope of the EDF , there are now funds under the so-called food facility , which will be EUR 100 million from 2009 to 2011 .
it is especially important that this body comprising members of EU institutions and Member State employees has full equality in this respect .
but I want to be clear , I do not want to step outside the overall framework , only to achieve greater flexibility within the framework in order to manage new needs .
although the EU has not endorsed all the recommendations , it made it clear that it takes the Goldstone report very seriously .
I also supported the &apos; Eurovignette &apos; amendment ; its review must not detract from the sustainable transport strategy .
next I come to data collection .
maybe the &apos; father or mother &apos; of the House has a logic .
they also form part of the commitments that Russia has entered into as a member of the United Nations , the OSCE and the Council of Europe .
if the already marginal network capacities are not used by freight companies , they will ultimately be eradicated to the disadvantage of all users .
it considers that the law endangers the free movement of workers , one of the greatest achievements of European integration , and is also a threat to the functioning of the European Union &apos;s integrated internal market In addition , the amended language law is declared by the Legal Service to contravene the Audiovisual Media Services Directive as well as Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , which addresses the freedom to provide services .
in writing . - This report which aims to bring more transparency , efficiency and accountability to European spending , is more relevant than ever to implement the EU budget by following the principles of sound financial management .
it is true that the disagreement that I referred to in my question may have been partially corrected ; however , it is still the case that the Danish aviation authority does not permit SAS planes to take off before they have resolved the technical problems , while other aviation companies are actually using planes which have these technical problems .
the Commission &apos;s progress report is expected on 7 November , and I think it is very important that the current positive developments in Turkey are reflected in that report .
am I right in saying that you have suggested a new and more subjective formula for applying that ?
this concerns essential research for rationalisation of the functioning of both the iron and steel industry and coal mining , as well as research leading to further improvements in finished product quality in this industry , that is to say coal and steel .
he remained in Poland after the fall of the Nazis in order to oppose the next totalitarian regime , namely the Soviet one .
the UNRWA has also had to suspend its programme of aid to the poorest people in Gaza .
as has been said , so-called &apos; humanitarian intervention &apos; very often conceals other real objectives that use and manipulate it according to the interests and unscrupulous calculations of the major powers and multinationals , calling the basic principles of international law into question .
this is one of the reasons why the PPE Group is calling for its application as soon as possible .
consequently , funding for its implementation should be increased .
the Services Directive aims to achieve full implementation of the single internal services market .
it also examines the existence and role of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) and the Early Warning and Response System for public health threats ( EWRS ) .
finally , I applaud the joint action promoted by the Council , namely to extend the right of sea and air pursuit of these pirates to the territorial waters of the coastal states , provided that the countries concerned agree , as well as to develop a mechanism for coordinated assistance against cases of maritime piracy .
that is what the compromise is bringing .
that was the last debate in our series of reflections on the future of Europe .
allow me to make three proposals : .....
measures helping to increase this transparency are therefore welcome and necessary .
I have said that clearly in plenary before , specifically when discussing the fruit and vegetable scheme .
thank you very much .
this is the paradox : even asylum seekers must be subject to mixed flows to enter the EU .
could you inform the President that if this Parliament is to demonstrate its true virility , we need to review these ?
and a similar message was also communicated at the foreign ministers &apos; informal meeting in Slovenia at the end of March .
the big question , of course , is what is going to follow in the wake of these events .
I also support the view that &apos; Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty &apos; .
one mudslide wiped an entire village off the map and killed hundreds .
( DE ) Mr President , President-in-Office , President of the Commission , it is the crowning achievement of the Portuguese Presidency that the Treaty of Lisbon is now ready to be signed , and many Members of this Parliament have certainly played their part too .
humanitarian grant agreements have now been concluded with four partner agencies : telecom Sans Frontières from France to provide emergency telecommunications services ; the Pan-American Health Organisation and the Spanish Red Cross to help re-establish health services , and the German Red Cross to supply shelter , safe water and basic household essentials .
these are my ideas on the what , why , who and how of intercultural dialogue .
it is a country of 2 million unauthorised buildings , many in forest areas ; villas can easily be built on burnt land and later connected to electricity and water thanks to vote-winning amendments made by governments .
for the European Union to accredit an ambassador of Robert Mugabe in this situation would surely be seen as an affront to decent people .
Commissioner , we support you in your approach of bringing more ecology and more greening into the first pillar .
I should just like to add this to the debate : over the long term , if the entry and exit system is to work , we will need to have systematic checks .
I support spending on the promotion of accessible artistic and cultural events which can enrich the lives of the population ; this is why is supported the LUX film prize , despite misgivings on the seemingly large budget spent on this particular award .
I have recommended the development of greener forms of tourism such as sports tourism or cultural tourism .
I now look forward to an interesting debate and hearing your views .
if I may , I would like to draw your attention to points 4 and 10 in the report , which stress the need to even out social and economic rights for women who are self-employed or who work on family farms .
in this respect , I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the military sector , whose activities sometimes interfere with and affect the marine environment , is going to be taken into consideration in Community policy in this field in order to prevent encroachment on the environment .
I support the principle that all democratic institutions have a duty to ensure that their activities , documents and decisions are made public .
( HU ) I was shocked when , during a food conference , I saw a sign in the hand of the African delegation saying : do not feed Africa .
it has actually been poorly prepared in terms of the common vision that we need and it has also been poorly prepared in terms of the coherence of the resources and instruments that we use .
we are calling for comparable , effective , consistent and complete data .
and together we can actually achieve the required double result of free movement of people and security and certainty for all countries .
it is my view that it is the application of the original legislation and not the legislation itself that is the problem .
a break with these policies is required , ascribing value to the roles of women , to their rights and to equality , and ascribing value to and strengthening , among other things , the network of services relating to rural resources , health , education and family assistance .
in the European Parliament , on the twenty-seventh anniversary of the signing of the August agreements , I would urge prudence in this case .
it is as though this institution somehow has a manic desire to prove its worth by sheer activity : good , bad , indifferent .
nevertheless , it is in the UK &apos;s national interest that Pakistan should now get trade preferences .
so I think it is unfair to show a picture of Herman Van Rompuy performing his responsibilities as President of the European Council on behalf of all of us in the host country with the person who was hosting the event .
I am sure that such a statement will , fortunately , be forthcoming later in the autumn .
they want the institutions to do this in partnership and in synergy and therefore they want cooperation .
the guiding criterion for the Doha Round has been to involve all member countries in negotiations on a whole range of matters , whereas in such a broad-based organisation efforts should be made to develop a plurilateral approach incorporating a form of &apos; variable geometry &apos; .
airlines are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and throughout the world .
( NL ) Madam President , let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur .
it will get worse if we do not do something .
failing that , could the Commission comment on any programmes it has developed to exchange best practice in this area between Member States ?
I would like to emphasise the importance of certain provisions in this plan , particularly those relating to the adoption of measures aimed at improving energy efficiency in existing homes and public buildings .
Mr President , as the Co-Chair of the Intergroup for Traditional Minorities , National Communities and Languages , I strongly condemn the actions taken by the Belarusian authorities against the largest Polish minority organisation and the members of the minority community .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
in addition to designing and building safer vehicles , Member States should also invest in the safety of road infrastructure .
however , the fact remains that the Dublin system was not developed as , nor is it intended to be , an instrument for burden-sharing .
some are Greeks , who are treated differently from other Europeans .
I fully support the idea that , while the information required can be compiled by the Member States themselves under this regulation in order to ensure comparability of data , we still need the Commission to coordinate the harmonisation of the statistical information .
as the Afghans have to adjust , so too do we , helping them to get an achievable state model combining modernity with the Afghan tradition .
there are also the so-called &apos; RALs &apos; or restes à liquider , which amount to EUR 130 billion .
the Joint Committee which is to operate the agreement has already met in June .
I would like to close with a comment on the political sleight of hand in reassigning funding for youth employment .
all medical assistance , regardless of its distinctive features , falls within the scope of application of the Treaty establishing the European Union .
given that next year is the European Year of Volunteering , it is particularly significant that the European Voluntary Service - which supports young people &apos;s participation in voluntary activity and aims to develop solidarity and promote active citizenship amongst young people - is strengthened .
( PL ) Mr President , I voted against .
indeed , innovation is an integral part of both the Commission &apos;s climate change package and the plan for revitalising the European economy .
the tax losses due to fraud are difficult to assess .
I hope that they really are all seeking democratic change , particularly now when , like Ukraine , they have huge economic problems .
they write a lot about the Tour de France , and it is a German who is wearing the yellow jersey there at the moment .
they are more demanding of the authorities in their countries .
this of course means monitoring the transposition of the relevant legislation into national law and , if necessary , instituting proceedings against those Member States that have been found to infringe European Union legislation .
it is not about permanent residence .
( DE ) Madam President , Mr Karas has already mentioned some key points .
the Council first decided to resume a dialogue , without pre-conditions , between the European Union and Cuba , based on reciprocity and dealing with all issues of mutual interest .
secondly , we need greater ambition in the transatlantic dialogue in relation to subjects to which both the rapporteur and the Commissioner alluded : Iran , Iraq , the Middle East , Afghanistan , etc .
the European economic recovery plan provides for major public investments for modernising transport and energy infrastructures .
there is one thing we need to bear in mind : if necessary , we could also import food , but not in a way that meets our conditions .
to address the challenges revealed by the crisis , the Commission has launched several policy initiatives .
printer companies have a business model based on selling their printers relatively cheaply and getting their customers locked into a contract to keep buying expensive printer cartridges .
according to World Bank statistics , around 44 million people in developing countries have fallen into poverty since last June , since food prices at the beginning of 2011 have reached the 2008 level , when rising food and oil prices had a significantly adverse effect on poverty throughout the world .
I voted for the Angelilli report because we need rapid , effective action to combat the causes and , above all , the effects of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
the solution for Britain is , of course , to leave the European Union , regain control of our territorial waters and restore sanity to a revitalised national fishing industry .
in order to have a balanced relationship with India , our Member States must do the same .
however , it seems as though the Agreement on Trade in Bananas has added a piece to the big Doha puzzle .
as always , however , it will be the taxpayer who pays for these &apos; efficiencies &apos; .
they are interested in international activities , but at the same time they have to take into account their regional and other affiliations , and also that in all international activities connected with human rights these aspects are not neglected .
this brings me to my second point , which is of particular importance to us at the present moment .
political representation in the European elections is a very important matter for countries with a large segment of population residing in another Member State of the European Union , such as Romania .
for the majority of countries , debt reduction is a crucial issue , given the negative effects that it has on economic incentives , and on the growth of the economy thanks to increased taxes and risk premiums .
it is important that the Member States show solidarity with each other and fairly share responsibility for compliance with international obligations .
nonetheless , in practical terms , I should like to point out two blatant omissions on the part of the Spanish Presidency .
particularly with regard to the increasing influx of migrants from Africa , it is essential for these states to coordinate the measures which they are taking in response .
we have a duty , as MEPs , to point out the need to respect these international obligations , such as human rights and gender equality , so that the dignity of women and the innocence of countless Congolese children are preserved .
it is unacceptable for us to treat those working according to a labour agreement on an equal footing with those who are self-employed .
however , we now find that you - contrary to what is contained in the Treaty of Lisbon , namely a horizontal commitment to protect consumers - have done exactly the opposite with the division of the portfolios in your European Commission , because now there is not just one commissioner responsible for consumer protection , but several .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Regarding the first question , there have been numerous bilateral meetings during the autumn in order to try to facilitate and prepare for the negotiations .
this requires a strong focus from the European Union .
in order to slow down migration in a sustainable and purposeful way , five things are needed : democracy , development , respect for international law , European solidarity and also , above all , no prejudicial rhetoric .
the only way to face this problem on a permanent basis is to improve the resilience of our sector to the increase in fuel prices .
however , the strategic partnership must be founded on the obligation of China to respect human rights , because we need partnerships with countries which are democratic , not totalitarian .
in order to ensure the success of the EU 2020 strategy , the regions also need to be more involved , and the European Commission must continue to simplify the procedures for accessing funds .
today , no more than a few hours ago , an important piece of legislation was passed , recognising citizens &apos; rights to take the legislative initiative , to give primacy to their right to citizenship .
finally , we managed to keep open the discussion about the Kyoto Protocol and a future legal outcome .
who would like to speak in favour ?
I agree with the rapporteur when he highlights the need , given the new competences conferred by the Treaty of Lisbon , for the European Parliament to monitor the various stages of negotiating and implementing the VPA , and when he calls on the Commission to provide Parliament with studies of the agreement &apos;s social , economic and environmental impact , amongst other documents for assessing its implementation .
nevertheless , I would like to remind you that , since Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union , the Black Sea has become a partially internal sea and we cannot ignore its strategic importance for the entire world .
there is a very obvious reaction within the Commission itself , just as there is on some of the benches here , because some people think that the EU has no part to play in the matter .
the EGAF has already been used in the past by other EU countries , in particular Portugal and Spain , and it is now time to provide such aid to Belgium and Ireland .
I support the idea that the European Parliament should put forward specific proposals on the financing and budgetary control of the future European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
I thank Parliament for all the support it will be able to give on this matter .
I would like to turn to digital issues next time , with rock solid arguments .
the European Union must act .
secondly , the model was created based on the exploitation of a single population , while the large majority of Community fisheries are multi-species , which means over- or under-fishing many of them , which is obviously contrary to the actual definition of maximum sustainable yield .
I have just described to you that Gdynia and Szczecin could be approached with an employment future that is viable .
( the President cut off the speaker )
the rapporteur for the European Parliament &apos;s report does not seem to be particularly concerned by these objections .
however , we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China .
there is a rise in global food demand against a background of higher production costs , worsening volatility in agricultural markets , less land , less water and reduced energy inputs .
in this way , the Fund &apos;s financial allocation for the 2008-2013 period would be reduced from EUR 628 million to EUR 614 million .
this regulation sets out Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use , establishes a European Medicines Agency and helps to ensure the right of patients to reliable , accessible and independent information , validated by the competent authorities , on the medicinal products available .
I have not forgotten any of the other issues .
about 4 million have left , leaving a net population increase of over 2 million .
I fully support Tunisia &apos;s democratic transition and development process .
this programme displays an appropriate degree of ambition given the sheer size of the consolidation needed and is a front-loaded programme .
I , too , declare my readiness to give extensive assistance in the negotiations .
we must consider these very carefully , with great intelligence , and remain mindful of the concerns and needs of all the countries affected .
yes , because European Union countries are proving that they do .
two and a half million people have left their homes to escape from the violence .
this approach links all the EU policies on the matter to five international challenges .
Serbia &apos;s route towards it has been particularly difficult since the end of the former Yugoslavia following the collapse of Soviet power .
in order to be active citizens , people must have a broader world view .
it is right that this should be looked at by the domestic regulators first , but I am hearing similar concerns from other EU Member States .
there are direct flights between the two and an economic cooperation framework agreement is already in force .
as far back as 2005 , the President of Azerbaijan , Ilham Aliyev , pledged that all the rights of journalists would be respected and that they would be able to count on help in the event of any kind of danger .
&apos;as little as possible &apos; should be the cornerstone of our action in this regard .
we cannot have credibility around the world if the measures we adopt in the management of immigration , in particular , and in our policies in response to the tragic events caused by terrorism , are not exemplary in terms of human rights .
however we say it , we are in a situation where the Multiannual Financial Framework is becoming exhausted .
such stations should come into being at the same time in all Member States to enable every European consumer to have access to them .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , I am pleased to be here today to inform you of the Commission statement in connection with the resolution that you are going to adopt on the New Flame shipwreck and its consequences in Algeciras Bay .
thanks to their feminine intuition , women enrich our understanding of the world .
we are therefore alarmed to note that some of the Member States are showing a tendency to enact and apply laws which are in no way justified by the directive &apos;s provisions .
I think that these points are well highlighted in this particular report , which is why I voted in favour of it .
I voted in favour of this document because democratic change cannot be imposed from outside or even by military means but has to be achieved through a peaceful democratic process .
this food crisis , where the poorest in our world will suffer the most , needs immediate action .
in this context , we will take the opportunity to discuss in a broader context the whole dairy sector .
we do not think that it is acceptable for the justification for all this to be &apos; waste of time and resources &apos; .
that should in no circumstances become an obstacle to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &apos;s membership of international organisations .
the other large group that should be considered are farmers in the new Member States , especially smallholders .
besides , I consider it unnecessary and costly to establish new structures .
. - ( SV ) Madam President , a global financial crisis is shaking the world economy and proposals for how to prevent it happening again are now coming thick and fast .
they have not yet fully rid themselves of the military presence of the Soviet Union &apos;s successor - Russia .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
they should not be allowed to get away with murder .
this resolution is , in my opinion , a message that the European Parliament robustly supports the Iraqi people , urging them to act against violence and terror and fight resolutely for democracy and universal human dignity .
could he , if possible , give some details about the effects of the economic crisis on world trade in agricultural products ?
so that is what this report is about : it is actually about setting the framework .
the unquestionable benefit of the approved legislation comes from improving the quality and therefore the safety of tyres .
that , therefore , is the reason for the attack suffered today by Greece , which needs special support .
in fact , we are dealing with a crisis requiring a global approach , both for reasons of effectiveness in terms of protecting our citizens and from considerations linked to solidarity with less developed countries .
it will give a boost to the car industry at what is a very difficult time .
in order to maintain this dynamic , last Wednesday , the Commission again adopted a range of proposals which , once converted into legislative initiatives , will be able to be implemented from 2011 if they are adopted in good time .
we have already significantly increased funding and hope that - in a coordinated effort with other donors - the overall funding level could reach the equivalent of what is spent per capita in comparable countries , like Laos and Cambodia .
the development of the Trans-European Networks , in which , as Mr Albertini has just pointed out , we are banking on the development of railways , brings about a modal shift which obviously leads in that direction .
it is high time that the Council acknowledged once and for all the democratic will expressed here by the majority of MEPs .
it is important , not just for national authorities , but also , and more especially , for those who are suspected or accused of a crime , that there are clear deadlines , procedural guarantees and other protection mechanisms in place .
however , the Commission &apos;s proposals also contain aspects which Parliament , and I as rapporteur , regard as less positive .
our first thoughts go out to them , of course .
thirdly , the report proposes that the European Parliament , the forthcoming European External Action Service and the EU missions abroad should have liaison officers responsible for the protection of human rights defenders .
this is a more austere budget , in line with what the Commission and Council requested .
there are also migrants coming to northern , eastern , western and central Europe , so this is an agency for the whole of Europe , even if it is no coincidence that it is located in Valetta .
similarly , Mrs Muscardini , you will always have my support when it comes to defending the food sovereignty of the European Union .
contrary to what has been claimed , although never established , removing protection for spare car parts would not lead to any gains by consumers .
we must encourage the Commission and Member States to start a debate and take action to increase the participation of women in politics .
second , democracy is , of course , about votes and elections - but it is also about far more than that .
district heating investments cannot be left out of consideration during harmonisation of energy investment policies .
there are legal systems in which the notary public is limited to certifying that the will of the parties is expressed .
this is not a revision of the figures for 2011-2013 , as was claimed by Mr Böge , Mrs Gardiazábal Rubial , Mrs Haug , Mr Dehaene and Mr Abad .
the power they produce is simply too expensive .
Mr President , this debate has shown that there are , at the very least , huge doubts as to whether the current legislation is working , whether it is properly enforced across all Member States , and even whether it can be properly enforced .
there is no defence for this obscenity .
in writing . - ( EL ) International and regional agreements to date have proved incapable of normalising market supply and trade and safeguarding transparent and stable prices for agricultural produce .
the Palestinian side , on the other hand , has not taken any such steps .
I see this as a small step in cutting the waste involved in travelling from Brussels to Strasbourg .
through today &apos;s resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre &apos;s budget for the financial year 2009 .
ultimately , it is all a version of what Engels called &apos; false consciousness &apos; : they believe that the Tibetans do not really understand the issue and , therefore , should not be allowed full democracy .
as usual , Parliament has sought to provide a stimulus , with pioneering proposals that I will not go into now as they are in my report and I am almost out of time .
we firmly opposed executions and the trampling of women &apos;s rights .
I live on a peninsula , so I understand island mentalities .
the chemical safety of toys is not just a regulatory matter ; it is also a hygiene issue and as such is vital for the safety of our children .
but we need to be mindful that we are legislating for the real world , not making a wish list for an ideal world , and that Parliament should stick to its areas of competence in future .
I invite the President to ask all Members who are in the pension fund to say so orally , in plenary , immediately , because they have a direct interest in what is to be discussed .
a new international treaty taking account of the changes that have taken place since Kyoto , in particular the extraordinary and explosive growth of the Asian giants : indeed , Bali is a crucial step in that direction , and while it will not be the place at which agreement is reached , it will be the place at which negotiations will start and it will therefore be very important for Bali to come up with a clear negotiating mandate , with precise deadlines , with a view to conclusion by 2009 .
I can guarantee that some Member States are in for a rude awakening in this respect .
continued isolation , on the other hand , would lead to a feeling of exclusion and prevent exchanges of ideas and , in the worst case , could foster narrow-minded nationalism .
over 60 people have been killed , including foreign nationals and , among them , citizens of EU countries , nearly 2 000 people have been injured , and the capital , Bangkok , has sustained a significant degree of damage .
I wonder would the Commission consider - given that we are very close to the election at this point - making sure that there is a dedicated group or number of people within each Member State with a particular telephone number etc. where candidates could immediately access the Commission for information on particular issues like that .
I have to tell you that Frontex now has a liaison officer in the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
we must aim decisively for double declarations and double transparency : those who deposit money in another country must declare it .
if we can work together with China and Africa to improve good governance , then I think we can deliver aid and trade and improvement .
it is therefore vital that businesses should be confident that similar procedures will be adopted for the designation of contaminated sites , thus allowing for planned investments .
it is not clear why the Council and the Commission gave up on this point : we do not intend to give up , and so we are voting against the report precisely because the origin certificate has been omitted .
when this issue first came up last month , I said that politicising this issue was not just attacking a Member State , but was also undermining the EU Presidency .
for all those years , the first key to Zimbabwe &apos;s fate has been held by South Africa , yet Thabo Mbeki has not only failed properly to discharge his responsibilities as a mediator but he has blatantly sided with Mugabe .
for people anywhere in the world , the development of international trade is , in fact , justified only where it contributes to economic development , employment and improved living standards .
political action needs to be taken to adjust and raise the threshold values accordingly .
today we are voting on the resolutions to approve the executive directors of the European supervisory authorities .
if these companies are not involved in cross-border activities or do not even operate at national level , this reporting obligation only serves to create a pointless administrative burden , thereby incurring costs for these commercial companies ( approximately EUR 1 170 ) .
for the funds needed we took EUR 1.6 billion from this year &apos;s unused agriculture expenditure , and EUR 200 million from the flexibility instrument , and the rest we obtained by prioritising and reallocating expenditure from heading 1a .
if approved exactly as agreed with the Council and without amendments invalidating it , the compromise text may represent a significant step towards implementing the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury .
Madam President , Finland does not need to be ashamed of its security policy solutions .
we are at the stage of the first reading of the draft directive on consumer rights , submitted by the Commission .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , I am pleased that there are in fact two commissioners here .
in addition , soaring food prices can be placed under control by regulating prices of traditional energy sources .
the modification to the regulation seeks to permit and extend this possibility targeting low income households in all Member States .
we must realise that this suits the genocidal strategy of the Bashir clique in Khartoum to divide and destroy the Darfur communities and the rebel groups in order to make peace negotiations , such as the ones that are supposed to start this weekend in Libya , go nowhere .
in any case , special resources are available for this from the Commission .
that mere fact has led to assassination attempts and a number of political and legal attacks by the ruling party , including a 12-year prison sentence .
we are assessing the instruments using a model-based quantitative analysis .
I think those of us who believe that things need to change in this regard , away from a system that rewards inefficiency at the expense of efficient agriculture , are those who truly believe in sustainable rural development .
it is obvious that we need more coherence .
I am absolutely certain that the security of the region , of Israel , depends on what can now be done to move forward .
what I wanted to say was that one of the saddest things I have ever seen in my life was in Addis Ababa at the fistula hospital we went to with a number of women colleagues as part of the ACP delegation .
of course , strengthening Parliament &apos;s role means that it has more obligations , more responsibility and more work .
the Commission is favourable to consolidation of the Community air sector , which it still considers to be too fragmented , particularly in view of the current crisis .
we support the coupling of agricultural aid to production , allowing the agri-foodstuffs production of countries such as Portugal to grow and , in general , allowing its primary sector to modernise .
I would not be surprised if we were to learn in the coming days or hours that it has been postponed indefinitely .
setting a specific target for biogas would introduce further administrative burdens for private operators and public authorities .
unfortunately , at that time the Commission was against this proposal .
this access must be set out in an interinstitutional agreement , and discussions are under way with the Commission and with the Council in this regard .
this must include clear and specific commitments , as the international community is a long way off honouring its commitments regarding the Millennium Development Goals .
we need coordination on the basis of a clear , precise strategy , with explicit priorities and a single voice outside the euro area , and we need governance that consists of continuing to make the Euro Group work more effectively , along the lines of what we have been doing under Mr Juncker &apos;s presidency since 1 January 2005 .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
equally , it is leading the European Union for there to be a general policy for getting out of such debt , debt that was essential to the European Union in the face of the crisis and in the face of the social need to tackle the crisis and to protect the most vulnerable .
closing down a political party is not , and cannot be , business as usual .
we in the European Parliament and the European Union want a strong partnership , relationship and , if possible , friendship with all countries in the Middle East .
excessive residues were even found in the fruit being sold in the European Parliament premises .
the first relates to industry standards .
improving and strengthening the European judicial area also means improving and modernising the way in which justice works , which in turn depends on our using new methods of communication ; this is the essence of the e-justice project .
after all , Moldova is close to Europe and must be supported at a time when this opening is present there .
moreover , as has been said here many times , these programmes are not sufficiently coordinated , and as a result of the low level of coordination and cooperation between Member States of the Union , the costs associated with resettlement are also high , which naturally makes this idea rather unattractive .
can I reinforce that the Copenhagen criteria are non-negotiable , especially when it comes to minority rights and human rights , and Macedonia and Croatia are therefore failing to reflect the Community acquis , especially as regards non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation .
moreover , it is not necessary to look elsewhere to uncover the reasons for the immense difficulties encountered during the accession negotiations .
scrutinise Greece , Spain and Portugal , but not my country .
we see winners and losers , the losers being the tens of thousands of local civilians who are withdrawing or fleeing in fear of government units .
no European country is immune from its impact .
billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks .
what we need to know is what the outcome will be .
take responsibility yourself for the accreditation of national inspection authorities and Parliament will give you its support .
homogeneity and reliability are the primary considerations here .
the Czech Republic , too , has an obligation to complete the ratification process .
since we believe it is important to have a permanent stability mechanism , the Commission played a constructive role supporting this limited revision of the Treaty .
I think this is crucial in shaping the future EU policy framework for sport , which - without prejudging developments regarding the Lisbon Treaty - we might have to implement as early as next year .
as far as I can see , there are seven months in 2011 which have 31 days in them .
the European Roma strategy can be a type of professional minimum .
in spite of the rapporteur &apos;s denials , the draft regulation assumes that third-country nationals enjoy free movement , freedom of establishment and free access to the labour market throughout the European Union ; it must be remembered that these are all things that , thank goodness , have not yet become a reality .
over the past four months , the Czech Presidency has been very active and responsible in holding talks with Parliament and submitting many compromise solutions to Parliament on various issues regarding the directive in a bid to find a final solution acceptable to the Council and to Parliament .
to follow up on this request , the Commission has put a great deal of effort into stepping up the dialogue and cooperation with Libya and Turkey , which are the two key countries on the illegal migration routes in the Mediterranean .
just look , for example , at the GSM standard which we jointly brought about in the 1990s ; that , too , was the right move at the right time .
other factors contributing to fishing mortality will also result in a revolution in the total cod caught when the TAC is established .
it would be in this context that the High Representative / Vice President would pursue increased participation by the EU in international coordination .
we are effectively talking about the same stock , from the same source , but , as has already been mentioned , this is a source that is developing in distinct fishing areas .
the procedures of this House are absolutely crazy .
I think that more clarity is needed about the terms for reimbursement and the regulations which form the basis for the preliminary authorisation system , when this is necessary .
a single digital market also requires determined efforts to develop a services market .
I know that this also has to do with Parliament and the Financial Regulation of the European Union and that it causes so many problems as a result of the procedures which we had under the Santer Commission 10 years ago .
we need to finalise the agreement .
Mrs Bauer has flouted the code of conduct of this institution .
many Chinese people &apos;s quality of life has improved .
consequently , it is evident that the European Parliament must intervene as colegislator to implement the fundamental reforms that have become necessary to stabilise the economic and monetary union .
( SK ) cyanide extraction techniques are associated with a high risk of environmental damage and therefore also pose a threat to human life and health .
in writing . - ( PL ) Overweight and obesity are something of a contemporary epidemic with dangerous consequences for the health and even the life of human beings .
I believe the European Social Fund needs specific and simple rules .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - Madam President , I do not want to aim this at anybody in particular .
farmers and gardeners must recognise that bees are totally defenceless when faced with toxic products and that they are precious contributors to their crops and need to be protected as a matter of priority .
I very much support this regulation .
well , this is impossible and we must say so from the start ; it calls for reform in the treaties and cannot be dealt with by the popular initiative .
their economic growth , like that of the BRIC countries , must be based on &apos; green technologies &apos; .
- ( NL ) Mr President , the report on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third country nationals that we have just approved is certainly not the worst report that has ever been passed here and it does , in fact , contain a number of very interesting recommendations , but I still think that the report fails to clearly tell the whole story and so I have not approved it myself .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , over 5 000 immigrants have arrived in Italy in the last few hours , while another 100 000 are setting out for Italy , France and Germany .
the second point is the need for clarification that these micro-credits are definitely intended for the long-term unemployed , people from disadvantaged groups and everyone who is unable to get credit in the ordinary way .
in addition , in order to maintain good environmental conditions in marine areas and respect the precautionary principle , it is necessary to reassess the limit of 100 nautical miles around islands , as it is vital to reclaim 200 miles so that ...
above all , it is important to confirm the end and not the beginning of a policy which in many cases is based on double standards .
we need a compromise , and this Parliament pointed the way at first reading with proposals such as the use of a quotient .
the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny will be used for the adoption of these provisions .
you should raise the matter again when Mr Pöttering is in the chair .
while it will not be my responsibility to endorse the arrangement , I would like you to be aware of the problem .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like firstly to say that the absence of the representative of the French Government today shows another side of a Presidency that is otherwise warmly congratulated for its political successes .
Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services .
this type of situation markedly reduces our farmers &apos; competitiveness and profits .
to conclude the debate I have received one motion for a resolution , pursuant to Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
however , recent years have brought several epidemic waves of the disease , affecting many Member States , including in central and northern Europe , causing significant losses to livestock production and disruption of the trade in live animals .
as Professor Monti has rightly observed , a certain fatigue with questions of the EU market can be felt in Member States , but it is precisely now that we need a strong common market more than ever before , as the crisis of recent months has shown us .
reserve should turn into thought-provoking policy .
( the oral amendment was adopted )
the countries of the South lose USD 1 000 billion each year in funds transferred illegally to the North , USD 350 billion of which pass through tax havens .
these , of course , would have to be WTO-compliant .
finding an answer to these serious questions is a challenging task for the common foreign policy of the EU .
the European Commission &apos;s seven key priorities are clear and I would suggest that Prime Minister Igor Lukšić &apos;s government addresses them in a determined fashion and in this way opens negotiations on Montenegro &apos;s full membership .
furthermore , we need internal burden-sharing within the EU .
this is a sensitive area that impacts upon societal values regarding deviant behaviour related to gambling and also upon national traditions of directing the sums received from this market towards the financing of social works .
( NL ) Madam President , if nothing else , the negotiations with Turkey have helped the Commission and Council perfect the art of euphemisms .
Mr Bonde &apos;s proposal has not been thought through and is in breach of the current statute .
the European Union , a symbol of human rights around the world , must guarantee fair treatment of third-country nationals residing in its territory and establish an inclusive policy towards them .
yet we must also take up the associated public-health challenges .
our proposal clarifies the situation and would oblige Member States to apply the required labelling rules .
I believe that we can only do that if we seek out a broad majority together .
in this connection I welcome the amendments proposed by Mrs Buitenweg on behalf of the Greens and thank her for her important contributions .
it could be an education society , which also extends to body education and exercise .
secondly , we need to act to improve risk management and economic governance .
we have avoided inserting an equals sign , however notional , between an existing State and a terrorist movement .
there is a clear attempt to sideline Parliament on this important issue and Parliament &apos;s Legal Service has confirmed that a different legal basis which would have allowed full involvement of Parliament in the process could have been chosen for this proposal .
we have known for decades that smugglers have a criminal interest in human trafficking and that often there are accomplices involved in catering for these illegal workers , who are poorly paid and badly housed .
I have great reservations about the outcome of the vote on Amendment 6 , which was tabled by a group of Members from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
that means reducing the costs of driving them , mile by mile , at a time when fuel prices are at a record high .
as a response to the crisis , the EIB has significantly revised upwards its targets : in order to help businesses and to encourage economic recovery , the EIB has substantially increased the volume of its lending , disbursing EUR 10 billion more than expected .
there are very many aspects to this , and President Buzek has always said that we need an energy community in the EU .
I disagree with this view .
one of the largest political parties in Poland almost ceased to exist recently , threatened by the withdrawal of subsidies due to minor financial errors .
this decision must be overturned because otherwise , this country will be unable to break free from the political deadlock that followed the elections and the instances of violence already being reported will increase .
where are the efficient cars which the Europeans wanted to be able to launch in bulk on the markets of the future then ?
the repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe .
I feel that it is very important to include the aspect of moral support in this proposal .
one extra question : I assume that arrangements are already in place in the current budget support system for support to be suspended in such a situation as that which prevailed in Kenya after the elections ?
Guy Bono &apos;s report is one of those .
I want to ask the Commission and our programmes to allocate funds to research in this area , too , in order to reverse these trends and improve women &apos;s health .
Italy is particularly interested in this text ahead of EXPO 2015 , which is to be held in Milan .
focusing on the situation in East Jerusalem , I welcome very much the Swedish Presidency &apos;s initiative and its clarity over the role of Jerusalem as a capital of two states and your firmness about the importance of Israel freezing its settlement activity in East Jerusalem .
the Continent and its people require a uniform rule of law , at least in the form ... at any rate in what the legal practitioner calls the general part .
I voted for this report as it contains specific provisions for improving consumer interests .
this is not an isolated case , ladies and gentlemen .
that means we have to measure what we have now and what we do better .
I would like to highlight that , on the one hand , the Treaty gives national parliaments greater influence and , on the other , it is based on the European Union &apos;s Charter of Fundamental Rights , thus maintaining and consolidating the binding force of this document setting out human and minorities &apos; rights .
a European plan for the car industry must be forward-looking and based on knowledge and development , not on poorer conditions .
( SK ) Madam President , current studies into the impact of climate change on Europe &apos;s forests indicate that there is a wide range of specific regional responses from forest ecosystems .
I also congratulate the European Parliament and all citizens of the European Union as well as the rapporteur for taking such decisions today that should advance more specific and targeted actions not only to cure those suffering from cancer , but also to ensure the prevention of cancer .
the focus is on the financial crisis , and rightly so .
we all know that , at the level of the ERDF and ESF Funds , and of the CAP Fund and so on , it is the Member States that add further complexities to our own European administrative complexities .
I will end with a request , Prime Minister .
this non-legislative report emphasises that this directive has the potential for further integration of the EU economy .
finally I would like once again to thank Mr Staes for his excellent work on a proposal that is very complex , but at the same time extremely important for the environment and for human health .
this report amending the general regulation on the implementation of Structural and Cohesion Funds is of particular importance to the European Union &apos;s citizens .
Mr President , when the Spanish Prime Minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , inaugurated the Spanish Presidency in Strasbourg , he made a speech about Europe 2020 without once mentioning why on earth the Lisbon strategy failed in the first place .
however , this means rejecting all forms of terrorism and violence and it means cooperation on a strategy to implement human rights .
it is so important .
the European social model is a model of an active society , where activity in the labour market is the key element .
minorities , particular the Baha &apos;is , are persecuted .
the Häusling report on the protein deficit in Europe and the search for solutions introduces some positive elements such as aid to farmers that contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions .
chemistry has made possible vaccines and antibiotics that have doubled our life expectancy , and it is key to developing new energy sources and improving food .
what is the current situation with regard to the deliberations on the introduction of a common consolidated tax base and , in light of the concerns expressed by the Irish electorate in the Lisbon vote on this matter , has the Commission modified its approach in any way ?
therefore , implementing the SBA strengthens the aspect of competitiveness .
we proposed a full format to the European Council , of course .
the solution would be to have national statements .
firstly , dismantling the Community preferences system too quickly can and will have dramatic consequences in some ACP countries that still export bananas .
greater effort needs to be made to raise skills in the adult population and to achieve flexibility and security across the labour market .
there are certain restrictions with regard to the documents of the Court of Justice of the European Union , the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank , but it is a significantly larger area than it was previously .
with more than 13 million poor people benefiting from the programme , with 19 Member States participating and with the scheme being a stable outlet for intervention products , this programme has certainly shown its value .
each committee will find , therefore , that one of its most important tasks is to ensure that our law does not consist merely of empty words .
only when the Roma pitch their caravans on the front lawns of our out-of-touch political class might they change their views on the benefits of EU membership .
publishers will still be able to offer online subscriptions through their websites , or by other means , but they will no longer be able to process the subscription via an App on an iPhone using Apple as an intermediary .
we might just as well be discussing abstract painting today .
the market for the Valencian textile sector is Europe and , within Europe , France , Italy and Germany .
I am really happy to be in the European Parliament .
the target for decreasing the education drop-out rate and increasing the proportion of the population with higher education has not yet been quantified , nor has the target been set for promoting social integration , and in particular reducing poverty .
I am in favour of adult education .
this is the great challenge for the European Union in this case : succeeding in communicating , mobilising and facilitating the link between European funds and the various projects which could be initiated in rural areas by women .
the UN recently announced that at least 20 000 people have abandoned the town of Abyei and fled to the south , following the withdrawal of the North Sudanese army from the area .
in short , at this stage in negotiations , three major blocs have emerged .
in Laos , this is the result of a programme of the ruling communist party , which treats Christianity as a religion representing Western imperialism .
this is particularly appropriate as we know that the Council intends to cut its budget by 4 % , the Commission intends to increase its budget by only 1 % , the Committee of the Regions by around 2.9 % and the Economic and Social Committee by an even smaller amount .
as you know , the GSP requires the ratification of some 30 international conventions on human and labour rights , environmental protection and good governance .
there are no longer any formal excuses to abstain from them .
nonetheless , I would like to emphasis four matters I consider to be very important .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like , in particular , to thank the two rapporteurs .
the European border appears to be as leaky as a sieve .
the Ford report is part of the legislative package for reforming economic governance , which consists of six reports resulting from months of negotiations .
alongside physical security and energy security , food security is a fundamental security pillar that is important for both peoples and states and for every individual .
after all , the people in Guantánamo Bay are prisoners , and not people that can be trifled with .
this certainly was not the case .
let me underline one particularly important point here .
colleagues , I realise that there are some Members who have come into the Chamber since we started Question Time and will not be aware of the huge time constraint we have been under in order to try to make progress .
it seems to me that when we are having to deal with challenges such as the economic crisis and the need to create growth , we should not be treating expenditure on the fight against global climate warming as a priority .
the first question is how do we improve energy-saving and energy efficiency ?
as a result , there will be a national downhill race in respect of this regulation .
the problem , Commissioner , is that currently we have consistent case law from the Court of Justice that states that workers from one country may work in another country for less than 50 % of the salary , under a directive which , it has to be said , was created precisely to prevent this .
this has been a long and intense debate , which I think has covered every essential aspect of the neighbourhood policy .
this debate is very necessary .
this is the first injustice .
thank you very much .
I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have .
twenty days ago , my own country , Italy , was also hard hit in the regions of Veneto , where two deaths occurred , Friuli-Venezia Giulia , Liguria and Calabria , with one fatality in each , and the province of Salerno in Campania and Tuscany , where three people died , with dozens of injured people having to be extricated from the mud and rubble and one person who is still missing in Rovigo .
it was an important occasion for discussing possible courses of action to be undertaken to help enterprises in order to sustain recovery and economic growth .
we will also have to decide whether it should be the entire legal person or the management who will be held liable .
the EU &apos;s commitment cannot and should not decrease in the belief that everything will now arrange itself automatically .
we want to increase the share of renewables , to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and products , and to increase investment in research and in measures for mitigating the effects of climate change .
Mr Medina Ortega tries to be very clear in his report and I applaud that , but there will always be a wish amongst legislators to use , as it were , alternative regulatory methods other than black letter law .
we took brutal action in favour of one camp and against another .
3 .
the EU is the most important trading partner for most ACP countries .
that is the way they are being interpreted .
continuing the analogy , I would like to draw attention to the fact that , if the same child were to be a Romanian or Bulgarian farmer in the future , I would say that he was going to receive what he deserved after eight years .
however , the way to overcome the objections and to pave the way for the acceptance and efficacy of the framework of the Eurovignette is to ensure , firstly , that the directive is applied strictly , transparently and quickly to all the Member States and , secondly , that all the revenue is channelled , as contributory resources , to transport infrastructures and is not used to plug well-publicised gaps .
it is tremendous to actually see what is going on on the ground there with a view to accession : major political breakthroughs , but also , and above all , entirely practical changes that benefit the people who live there .
( the oral amendment was not accepted )
countries , international organisations and individuals reacted to the violence of the occupying forces , sending messages of support to Vilnius .
your attention is also drawn to the conclusions on the expansion and reinforcement of the Global Approach to Migration , adopted by the Council in June .
it needs to be broadened and made more flexible .
the Council , meeting behind closed doors , is unable to adopt a common position .
a new instrument has been created within the scope of European structural policy , the JEREMIE support initiative , which , above all , is about providing easier access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises .
the chances of the EU and the international community changing the basic reality in Somalia are slight .
it is a budget for the regions of Europe .
in particular , the problem with SIS II , which has been delayed for reasons which are unacceptable and have been much criticised by Parliament .
nevertheless , you did not answer my question very clearly .
this does not augur well , in particular in the context of the continued protests following the closure of a broadcaster critical of the government , in which students and opposition members have time and again clashed violently with the security forces .
Mr President , for the next six months , you will hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union .
we also rejected the idea of special national provisions , because the labelling system should , as far as possible , be standardised .
you want to get rid of the British rebate , which will mean by 2013 , our contribution will be GBP 13 billion .
that is why the Member States must immediately launch a programme of deep renovations in the existing building stock to achieve a nearly zero level energy consumption in the built environment by 2050 .
establishing a maximum detention period is an essential element of the directive .
that is the picture .
instead , I conclude that more mutual responsibility and more solidarity must be accompanied by mutual intervention .
I shall then propose adoption of the Council &apos;s conclusions on the Commission &apos;s communication on deforestation .
that is certainly the least that the Members of this House can ask .
we will then have to watch closely to see whether Southern Sudan is actually prepared to fulfil this agreement .
( PL ) Madam President , the Union &apos;s relations with Russia have to be a two-way street .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of discharge for the Director of the European Medicines Agency in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2006 on the basis of the report by my Austrian colleague Mr Hans-Peter Martin , which recommends to Parliament to give discharge .
measures such as these are , in my view , a magnificent example to others .
Madam President , as we review the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , let us be reminded that its creation truly marks a success for liberal democracy and a commitment to effective international law .
the groups have a statutory responsibility to participate in the debates .
thank you .
this was the first time that the European Union was able to explicitly recognise last year &apos;s summit conclusions , in the study we presented some time ago , and now in the cultural agenda for the European Union at a time of globalisation .
we have talked a lot about equal opportunities for men and women , equal rights in the labour market , and it is clear that longer maternity leave , and paternity leave too , will create a better basis for that .
in writing . - ( PT ) Women are playing an increasingly important role in the agricultural sector and rural areas .
you have yourselves mentioned earlier this evening that we must indeed pay special attention to effectiveness and costs .
furthermore , with regard to complaints , the carriers must set up and activate a system for dealing with complaints relating to the rights and obligations referred to in this regulation .
there was only one objection with respect to 15 July , which came from you .
there is an inherent conflict of interest if market participants devise internal credit risk assessments for their own regulatory capital requirements .
( SK ) The Goldstone report , the conclusions and recommendations of which we are debating , ignores Israel &apos;s right to self-defence .
at the moment , it is quite high - around 40 % of the total energy used .
and there are , in fact , something like 900 million people - at least the question said 900 million and I do not think the Commissioner questioned that - living in urban slums ?
it is , however , way too early to discuss what these measures could cover .
alcohol plays a part in the majority of homicides , and it causes 17 000 needless deaths on the road a year .
although the two directives function independently in theory , in practice they need one another .
lack of clarity in cofinancing rules ;
paragraph 2 states that one of the priority topics to be discussed at the summit should be &apos; the issue of introducing a bank levy or a transaction tax at global level &apos; .
the Commission has negotiated free trade agreements as part of the stabilisation and association agreements to create the conditions for political and economic reforms and to set the basis for the integration of the Western Balkans into the EU , for example by means of alignment to the acquis .
we should stick to the facts and when we refer to persecution we should remember who is persecuting whom .
there was a delay and we know the reason for this was because there was an internal debate in the Commission about whether to give a separate value to tar sands .
we need to feed the poor , especially in this economic crisis , and I will be advocating changes to the scheme that will achieve this end .
if any way is to be found out of the crisis , the President of the Republic needs to be elected immediately and a new government must be formed in accordance with the Constitution .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
the EU is an ageing society , and therefore the influx of migrants should not be regarded only as a threat to European labour markets .
he exists , but he is not recognised by everyone as a rapporteur , although , in fact , he is one .
because , ladies and gentlemen , the reason why these crosses appear on these flags is no different from the reason why crucifixes are displayed in Italian classrooms , and it is not a religious reason but rather a cultural and traditional one .
the EAS representative there said that it was spent on reforms .
just doing a bit of window dressing is not enough .
4 .
the growth of GDP is increasingly dependent on the size of the services sector .
Parliament &apos;s Resolution of 2 February 2006 recommended that the Member States adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women , and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims .
it is an offer to make us small and weak .
we also demand that products be manufactured in decent working conditions without risks to the health and safety of employees .
transparency is important and its importance is growing in the age of globalisation .
we want to ensure that the right incentives are in place for everyone to take action to limit global warming and to adapt economic strategies so as to favour climate-friendly development .
the European Union has no authority in this area .
beverages of this kind are part of the culture in some parts of Europe and make an important contribution to the local economy .
recently , at Manchester Airport , a new trial was started and legal advice has now been given that to use these machines on minors could be in breach of child safety and protection legislation because of the nature of the image produced .
the European Council is expected to reaffirm the European Commission &apos;s decision made at the end of last year and launch the accession process .
there is nothing to show that there will be any real benefit to consumers .
I can tell you that you have the full support of the Liberal and Democratic Group for the forthcoming years in your work .
when you do decide to withdraw , you will be faced with a debt to the eurozone that has been inflated by your own devalued currency .
the next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
now , one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation , data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system , but not without running into difficulties .
for that reason , it is imperative to open dialogue between all the parties , the Chad Government , the opposition and the rebels , to which they committed themselves with a view to free elections in 2009 , in accordance with international standards .
mobilisation of Globalisation Adjustment Fund : Odense Steel Shipyard / Denmark (
in addition , the Commission is delaying in implementing the commitments it assumed in this communication .
transatlantic security surrounded by democratic guarantees is essential for short-circuiting the financing of terror .
in accordance with the conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council last week , it will take up the matter again when the Commission has submitted its opinion .
as recalled yesterday in this House by President Barroso , the first summit in Washington was a European initiative by the French Presidency and President Sarkozy , together with the Commission .
though the European Union remains firmly committed and engaged , it is actually unclear how far discussions will pick up in the coming weeks .
the EU should not legislate without strong reasons .
1 .
transparency is very important for us to monitor what is happening there .
collective bargaining does not count .
this has been a tough fight .
large quantities of waste equipment are still being shipped illegally to countries outside the EU .
I agree with the report and welcome it with satisfaction because it will grant new rights to those who apply for international protection , including refugees .
finally , the Commission recognises the need for better mainstreaming of climate change into its own aid programmes , in close coordination with the partner countries and development partners at country level .
Mr Reul &apos;s report is extremely important in the context of the current economic crisis and the challenges linked to climate change .
however , with such a crucial industry as the automobile industry in a fairly unhappy mode , there is a need to try for more .
although various causes with different origins have contributed to the spreading of this phenomenon , I would like to insist on an essential aspect of the debate created on the subject of extremism , namely immigration .
signature of acts adopted under codecision : see Minutes
I do not think that it is helpful to anyone , and certainly not the poorer countries .
why am I talking about this sports event ?
we cannot allow it to take years for the European Union to implement NEAFC decisions .
we are in an election year and we are in a year in which Europe has also very extensively committed itself internationally to climate protection .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , we have firmly believed for a long time that an EU-Central Asia Strategy is vitally important and will have a positive effect on security , stability and prosperity in the countries of Central Asia .
this must not only be included in the constitution , it must also be put into practice .
it can extend society &apos;s knowledge in the area of healthy living , for example , by campaigns and educational measures , but it cannot be a substitute for this knowledge .
this is one of the keys to the freedom of the press and without it , there can be no meaningful freedom of expression in our community .
we have done so , even though the comments contain a passage stating that the EU should move towards a low carbon economy .
the Commission &apos;s legislative proposals on short selling and over-the-counter derivatives are also indispensable to making the financial system more transparent and resilient .
although this motion for a resolution has good intentions to protect European citizens , the inappropriate use of these important data cannot ultimately be ruled out .
we are currently at the bottom of the cycle .
we must also help our manufacturers when it comes to medicines , but I think that we will all agree that this must not be to the detriment of those who are dependent on access to cheap medicines .
I will say it : it is possible to be in favour of a European structural economic policy without favouring an increase in the deficit .
I believe that before introducing further measures we need to evaluate the full , systematic implementation of existing mechanisms , to avoid the risk of creating greater problems than those we are seeking to overcome .
we support the rights of citizens and consumer protection when we engage in international , European trade .
Mr President , let me remind you that a delicate national consultation is under way in Qatar .
this applies particularly to the global division of labour for manufacturing firms in Europe .
I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that we must be very careful , taking note of the experience of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya , and that the European Union should be much more rigorous when demanding compliance with international law .
with extra powers come responsibility , and the endorsement of the Lyon report on the future of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) post 2013 shows the Parliament taking its responsibility seriously .
what really does not belong in this regulation , however , is responsibility for the origin of the ingredients of a product .
regarding the trade issue , last year &apos;s European Union-Japan Summit agreed to examine the options for how to best to improve our relations .
we can no longer consider and perceive ourselves separately from Europe .
I have just said , Mrs Blinkevičiūtė , that pension funds are major institutional investors .
it is hard to envisage both foreign and domestic business investments in such a climate .
I welcomed receipt of the &apos; EU strategy for youth &apos; , in which information on the situation of young people of Europe was collected for the first time , as well as the three priorities for youth set by the Commission .
in 1989 , we undoubtedly knew and had consultations with many people from abroad .
Vice-President of the Commission . - I can say that Plan D played a key role in testing new methods for civil society organisations to involve citizens from all walks of life in debates on the future of Europe .
rapporteur . - Mr President , first of all I think it is important to say that no one should be against increasing the level of safety and strengthening the safety rules .
citizens are flooded with conflicting information and misinterpretations in the press on a daily basis .
of the necessary measures suggested , I would stress the development of equality plans and combating domestic violence by establishing a European year dedicated to the issue .
increased interconnection with countries which are not part of the area of freedom , security and justice must not facilitate the influx of international crime or make smuggling and human trafficking easier .
are these the standards of police behaviour in a democratic state that is a member of the Council of Europe ?
Mr President , finally , I wish to thank our rapporteur .
I do not know how much longer we will be able to survive without realising that killing many people , little by little , every day , is just as reprehensible as killing many people in one day .
all discussion of these issues must be transparent , with a view to raising people &apos;s awareness and securing their support for what we undertake .
this means that the entry into force of the SWIFT agreement would not provide any added value in terms of protection .
I believe that this directive will also provide more organs , thanks to better cooperation and cross-border swaps between individual countries , and that it will link EU Member States together in a new and fundamental way .
we need to act rigorously .
if this Council meeting had a motto , it would have to be &apos; there is no time to waste &apos; .
however , this agreement incarnates a first step which brings most of the parties together and provides a basis for commitments to reducing , financing , measuring , notifying and verifying actions to mitigate climate change and combating deforestation .
what role will the Commission , the Member States and the regions play ?
why was that ?
the problem of climate warming is one of the main issues troubling the modern world .
I have one big Christmas wish , and that is that when the climate conference is over and all the participants have stopped acting like administrators and technicians who talk only of details and quotas , we can then finally have a political debate about what can realistically and practically be done to improve conditions for our planet and its inhabitants .
however , we should not be surprised at this when our new High Representative for Foreign Policy was once described by MI5 as a Communist sympathiser and , when she was Treasurer of the CND , it took money from the Soviet bloc to undermine her own country &apos;s defence policy .
the high-tech edge Europe has will enable us to enjoy to the full the potential and benefits of the &apos; green &apos; economy in the future .
it has also been stated , however , that we ought to apply the strictest standards of all in the toy sector .
with regard to south-eastern Europe in particular , with its long history of the break up of states and empires , it is right and proper that the people in these countries , which form part of a troubled region , have been offered the possibility of membership of the European Union .
now that ground forces have been attacked , I think that there is good reason to question whether this nofly zone was created for that .
Guinea
torture is used .
young people must be supported to enter the labour market in order to secure their own futures , as well as contribute to economic growth and prosperity .
( PT ) Madam President , I would like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the 100 000 Portuguese teachers who demonstrated in an impressive and imposing &apos; March of indignation &apos; in Lisbon on 8 March last , organised by the Portuguese National Teachers &apos; Federation .
who speaks of those who , in their millions and tens of millions in Europe , are in a difficult social situation , who do not access employment at any level of hierarchy or qualifications ?
we approved the so-called delegated acts under provisions based on the Treaty of Lisbon ( I will finish shortly ) .
I got a very clear picture of a country that does not have a proper market economy and a country that has far too much government engagement in the judiciary , in the media and in business .
of those 19 , 17 were small businesses that employed three people or less .
so , speaking personally , I am concerned that these emergency trade preferences will appear to reward the Pakistani Government for its lack of action in this respect .
even though the number of women in the labour market is higher than the number of men for the first time in history , instances of gender-related discrimination persist .
this is exactly what we have been doing for the past years since the renewed consensus on enlargement which was adopted by the European Council and endorsed by the European Parliament in December 2006 .
no wonder that we are facing a climate catastrophe and biological impoverishment .
Mr President , these reports are at best bestrewn with paradoxes and at worst are full of hypocrisy .
the European Union , through its High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , should make freedom of religion and belief and the security of religious communities , including Christians , a priority in the Union &apos;s international relations .
combating corruption in European Sport - The work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus ( written declarations )
we will undoubtedly return to this debate in the summer of 2011 , when the Commission will present several new options for financing the EU .
a great Czech once said : &apos; I am no longer a rookie : goals are expected of me ; scoring is my job . &apos;
immediately after the vote , I will begin a study to consider the possible introduction of a European system .
the importance of the agriculture sector to the environment must be addressed in Nagoya , and this issue should be central when the future and budget of the CAP are being discussed from now on .
thus I would like to propose that we focus more on the quality of travel accommodation of these animals , instead of on the time on board , so that we do not hinder the transportation of animals to and from Ireland .
the opposite - secrecy and the withholding of documents - creates mistrust and a sense of not being involved , and can sometimes aid in the development of corruption and the abuse of power .
I would like to hear the truth and for Mr Weber to confirm whether these statements are his and , if not , I would like him to publish a denial and to send a copy to this House , so as to prevent the damage caused to public opinion by this type of contradiction , amongst the general public .
the Government of the Slovak Republic is among those conducting bilateral discussions with the United States , in the genuine belief that as a result of these discussions Washington will act more quickly and be more helpful .
the relaunch of the Lisbon Agenda for more and better jobs in 2005 gives rise to the need for accurate , timely and comparable statistics on job vacancies in Europe , by region and by economic activity .
we will support Poland , but Poland must also understand that , as one of the larger countries of Europe , it has rights but it also has duties .
what did we get ?
I therefore applaud the fact that the report calls for the creation of infrastructure making it possible to evaluate the impacts of proposals and plans formulated in Parliament .
however , this amendment is not worded appropriately for meeting this objective and , moreover , adoption of this amendment would result in the demise of the whole compromise .
the next item is the Commission statement on practical aspects regarding the revision of EU instruments to support SME finance in the next programming period .
the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon around six months ago on the one hand , and the global financial and economic crisis , its impact and the reaction of the European Union to it on the other , definitely mean that we have arrived at the end of an era in the life of the Union and the beginning of a new one .
why does the process of creating a shared operating airspace for both civilian and military flights over a united Europe take such a long time ?
we cannot go back to the extremes of the days of rampant capitalism - the world of Oliver twists !
in the meantime , the EU is , and will be , urging Belarus to take further irreversible steps towards democratic standards , without which our relationship cannot develop to its full potential .
( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , both Mrs Gomes and Mrs Lochbihler are right when they say that the events in Egypt and Tunisia should be receiving our support and should be attracting our attention , and indeed the instruments which we are debating , today , do create this possibility , particularly the financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide .
EU licences had just been renewed for their waters and they too had seen it all before .
seasons greetings to everyone .
food security is impossible without guaranteed economic sustainability for producers .
I disagree , however , that the calendar of 2013 was put to vote together in this plenary .
taking its lead from the Treaty of Lisbon , this text argues that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) should form the basis for the collective defence of EU Member States .
the Commission must centralise the information relating to actions taken by Member States to combat tax evasion , show which of these were most successful and recommend what measures it deems most appropriate for correcting fraudulent behaviour .
in recent times , 173 individuals have been arrested on suspicion of killing or injuring albinos .
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , you will all be familiar with Google , the internet search engine .
this , in turn , could undermine the credibility of the European Union in the context of the GFCM and other international fisheries management organisations
we note that the number of opium-free provinces in Afghanistan has more than doubled this year .
I shall turn now to the second issue , which is the SET Plan that we are discussing .
he has been in the Romanian Parliament and supported the Boc government and Traian Băsescu .
you have highlighted the upgrading of public transport , greater road safety , and environmental aspects in driver training and satellite navigation .
the discussions about appointments over the last few days lead me to fear that we are not looking for the best , European solutions , but for the easiest solutions for the Member States and the political parties .
why is this ?
following the Treaty of Lisbon &apos;s entry into force , its opinion is binding , but only in terms of the final text which has already been signed ; it cannot make suggestions or changes to its content .
in essence , Mr President - and I agree on this - the problems that we are trying to solve with these two instruments are serious and very often really tragic .
the fragmented nature of programmes supporting SMEs is also problematic .
this would enable us both to combat maritime piracy , a phenomenon that we have seen the return of in recent years , and to protect the natural heritage and archaeology of these areas in order to prevent any catastrophes that would have disastrous effects on the development of the Union &apos;s coastline .
I agree that the position on delegated acts must be approved and reiterated at second reading .
in this respect , the PRC needs to assume its responsibility as a member of the UN Security Council by exerting pressure on North Korea .
Mr Brok concedes that , without a serious alteration in the current EU policies , the EU &apos;s internal cohesion may be undermined by enlargement .
I believe it would be useful - and it is something I will propose - to invite the 12 so-called &apos; new &apos; Member States to work with the Commission on the basis of the tenth European Development Fund programme .
as others have said , counterfeiting is often seen as a victimless crime , but of course , as we are discussing , it is far from it .
I am referring , for example , to inventions of medicines .
they are subject to the same market-abuse disciplines as other participants in financial markets .
as the main goals of this revision are to simplify and set out the regulation in a new edition and at the same time reduce the unnecessary administrative burden , thus implementing the Commission &apos;s obligation to achieve better regulation , ensure compliance with the Montreal protocol , amended in 2007 , ensure that problems arising in the future are solved with the aim of regenerating the ozone layer in time and avoid negative impact on people &apos;s health and ecosystems , I voted for this legislative act .
so I appreciate what has been done here today and I think that , from today on , we should also move on to dealing with the financial terrorists of the rating agencies and the speculators who are playing havoc with people &apos;s lives and trying to bring down sovereign governments .
they must know if the meat they eat has been fed on GMs .
the EU &apos;s Data Protection Directive does not apply to state activities in the area of criminal law , nor does a framework decision on data protection in police and judicial cooperation apply in this case , given that no EU Member State authority is involved in executing the US court order and that no personal data is transmitted or made available by the competent authority of another Member State .
a human community is characterised by having advantages , strengths , disadvantages and weaknesses .
nor would this be possible .
topics such as lifelong learning , of course , begin with teachers .
that , I am afraid , makes them Icelandic property .
I would also like to emphasise the need for the simplification measures proposed by the Commission during the review of the regulations applicable to the Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period as a response to the current financial crisis .
I think that it is about time that the Commission implemented this article .
well , dear , oh dear .
funds made available from the European budget and coordination among various civil protection bodies are already in operation , thanks to the experience acquired .
the Council must be able to guarantee that it can provide MEPs with all the information required to enable Parliament to adopt a suitable , fair decision .
we can argue about whether or not they could or should have been larger .
the directive under discussion aims to establish a common system of invoicing for value added tax through an exercise of simplification and reduction of the administrative burden ; this is essential to achieving greater integration of the internal market and reducing unjustified costs for companies .
cooperation between universities and business is one option - no , it is more than that , it is indispensable .
it is therefore necessary to update the legislation on the collection of data and statistics .
however , a ban must be based on scientifically sound findings and not on political dogmas .
Mr President , in spite of its horrible consequences , international terrorism is still , sadly , a controversial subject .
as a technical , autonomous and independent body , recommendations regarding this subject should come from the IAEA with the proper support from the EU , and not the other way round .
given that it has taken several years to reach the point of voting on the coordination of social security we have had the pleasure of working with Finland , Germany , Portugal , Slovenia and France .
therefore , if we want to anchor Kosovo in Europe and ensure regional stability in the Balkans , it is vital that we come up with a common approach towards the whole region and Kosovo in particular .
within months he had stood down , having performed his function of bringing ridicule upon the European Parliament .
the initiatives will only be able to be implemented , however , if they meets certain procedural requirements or requirements on compliance with the European Union &apos;s fundamental values , in order to prevent the instrument from being used for non-democratic purposes .
others , like Hannes Swoboda and Jan Marinus Wiersma , stress that we should not take a black-and-white approach to this and that Ukraine deserves some attention - you are also right : of course Ukraine is not making this easier .
thank you , Mr Zapatero , for your speech .
there will be another commissioner - because we must also be serious about this , we must also see that there are problems to do with insecurity in Europe and that there are things that we can do together with the added value of Europe - who will also look at other issues , but always with the same spirit : the spirit of security , with full respect shown for individual freedoms and with full respect shown for fundamental rights .
we saw them shouldering pickaxes and spades and marching joyfully off to work .
any measures aimed at improving conditions in these countries are very important .
- ( CS ) Mr President , I would like to explain why I refrained from voting on the Hutchinson report .
so , to be clear , the ECR opposes this legislation , we oppose the concept of having transnational parties .
Madam President , the countries proposed for EU membership are comparatively poor .
the European Union is divided into a northern and a southern camp , be it on the subject of quotas for textile products or of the reform of trade defence measures .
without commenting in detail on the content of this report , against which much criticism can be levelled , against , I would like to draw attention to one article which I will vote against , even though I have had rejected in the Commission an amendment intended to remove it .
in writing . - ( NL ) A strong common agricultural policy with appropriate resources is necessary to ensure food safety .
and also we get clear involvement of the European Investment Bank in this area .
there is another list containing those nationals who are exempt from that requirement .
( PL ) Madam President , 87 years ago Lenin , the then leader of world Communism and of the Soviet Union , took the decision to separate three regions from Georgia .
that bus and coach transport companies should be responsible for losses or damages that result from the death or bodily injuries of passengers , caused by accidents related to using transport services .
the Council called on the Chad and Sudanese governments to fulfil the obligations they accepted in the Treaty of Tripoli and , in particular , to stop assisting the armed movements that are causing the instability of this region .
Transnistria was mentioned .
that also applies to the Social Fund .
what we do know is that some appalling human consequences are not being matched by any evaluations backed by convincing evidence , both regarding actual transfers and regarding the prevention of secondary movements or multiple claims , even though these are the very reasons why the Dublin system was created .
above all , it tells us that we need to organise a rapid exit from nuclear power and to focus our attention on renewable , alternative power sources .
access providers may be forced to cut their customers &apos; connection or to supply information on them .
we feel that the importance of the framework regulation that is to be adopted lies in the fact that it will increase market competition without overlooking an appropriate level of consumer protection .
you can use the same instrument in a very restricted way , or you can use it in a very wide way .
we also need a common European Asylum System that is more efficient and more protective .
this is a key political goal for the development of all these countries .
but be warned : we will not just &apos; sign off &apos; on any deal .
a moment ago , our fellow Member , Mr Sonik , reminded us of how disastrous such pollution would be in the Baltic Sea , for example .
the South Stream project would only increase the EU &apos;s dependence on a single source .
all these comments will be checked for accuracy .
that is why we have been looking for a modest instrument with which the EU can implement policy in developing countries that does not , strictly speaking , fall within the scope of fighting poverty .
thank you .
last , but not least , I would like to remind the Commission of the commitments undertaken in the trialogue of July , namely to ensure an adequate number of jobs for the new Member States .
so what do we see this year ?
the most important step would be to hold referendums on subjects that point the way forward , where the results of these referendums would have to be respected .
as representatives of the interests of citizens , we must strive to ensure that the EU does not conjure an image of a legislative maze in people &apos;s minds .
people are looking for work , businesses are looking for markets , consumers are looking for reliability , Greece is looking for stability and Europe is looking for its role in the world .
in this regard , the promotion of sales is more important than stockpiling .
we must have more facts and not fiction , and we certainly should dwell on the facts .
particularly problematic are rural areas , where consumers suffer because they are deemed too commercially unviable to be given adequate broadband coverage .
in writing . - ( PL ) As joint author of the European Parliament &apos;s resolution on Belarus , I would like to draw attention to the state of democracy , respect for human rights and in general to the situation of the people of Belarus .
this will be done within the existing funds .
new international organisations and fora have emerged - an example is the summit diplomacy of the G20 , G8 , G7 , etc . - and there are proposals to reform the traditional international organisations .
I call upon all parties to rapidly come together right now over this and , once and for all , bridge this unfair digital divide .
he has forfeited all rights to claim democratic legitimacy , because of his wanton disregard for human rights , political freedoms and the rule of law .
the enforcement of such penalties , at least non-financial ones , on all car drivers in Member States would lessen the confusion experienced by many hauliers or individual drivers as a result of legislative discrepancies between the country of origin and a third EU Member State in which they are driving .
subject : Sri Lanka
that is why I am calling on you to mobilise all your resources and contacts to ensure that this summit proves a real success .
I would like to remind you of a fact from history that should be useful to you .
I would like to draw attention to the difficulties faced by the inhabitants of the Russian Federation &apos;s Kaliningrad Region .
not one EU Member State would accept responsibility .
( LV ) Mr President , fair trade in agricultural products is one of the most important driving forces in the economic development of developing countries .
that is very important and I do ask for understanding on this point , because on this issue some of the population has found itself pushed to the limit .
the negotiations have been fruitless and will remain so ; it follows that he will have to stay in Paris .
recently , the Chinese authorities detained 30 pupils from a school in Machu , who , on the second anniversary of the events in Lhasa at the beginning of March , gave expression once again to their convictions and began a peaceful protest .
that is a fact .
the Commission agrees that the issue of managing online rights for the redistribution of TV and radio programmes merits close attention .
I apologise to Mr Madlener , to Ms Theocharous and to Mr Hadjigeorgiou , who are also present .
thus the decision to send the EULEX peace-keeping force to Kosovo to take over the role that until recently had been played by UNMIK is a tactical error .
it makes sense for these rules to be mandatory for maritime transport , as they are already mandatory for road transport , rail transport and inland waterway transport .
in order to really exercise control over an administrative bureaucracy , national governments , the Commission or the Council apparatus here in Brussels and in Strasbourg , we must establish close cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments .
I think that Mr Lehne &apos;s proposal to exempt micro-entities from the burden of annual accounting , thus producing a reduction in administrative bureaucracy , is a positive one .
these aspects are not covered in the report , and I therefore chose to abstain .
it is for Christians and for those who are being attacked .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , I think this debate is a timely one and that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck &apos;s report includes a number of important recommendations .
in these circumstances , I simply feel that it is not the best time to enter into an international agreement with long-term consequences .
if I had to face all those workers , then I would prefer to say , please go with this solution which the Commission is offering .
Burma &apos;s neighbour , Thailand , has seen many refugees cross the border : according to some estimates , as many as two million people have fled over the past 25 years , and tens of thousands who have been refused entry remain homeless in the no man &apos;s land along the border .
we would have preferred simply to have a system proposed by the Commission and approved by the Environment Committee , which made it perfectly clear that a whole series of offences were automatically classed as punishable under criminal law in addition to the directives in question .
financing for the EIT &apos;s networks of Knowledge and Innovation Communities ( KICs ) is also , in principle , open .
I find it fatal to oppose the Southern neighbourhood and the Eastern neighbourhood .
it is therefore very important to take diplomatic action towards these countries and find ways of helping them from the point of view of both security and development .
stating it in these terms is not just semantics : it is a philosophical choice that we are making .
that is my opinion , and I will continue to ask Council to act on this invitation .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m.
I voted in favour of this report because it talks about sensible issues like energy efficiency and energy security related to the climate change agenda .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
the Commission &apos;s proposal does not establish a uniform patent for the entire territory of the Union as required by Article 118 , and enhanced cooperation has a negative effect on the establishment of enterprises and the free movement of capital .
as such , it is a fundamental step that had to be taken and must be taken as rapidly as possible .
it goes without saying that we voted against the report .
Mr President , on my return from New York , I will visit you to discuss the Commission &apos;s strategy on equality .
I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member , Mrs Balzani , defining the position of Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations on the 2012 budget .
if anyone was waiting for the speech by Mr Georgiou of the Independence and Democracy Group , they are in for a disappointment , as he is not in the Chamber .
at any rate , everything can be revised .
Mr President-in-Office , I am grateful to you for the fact that we are utilising the opportunity afforded by single legal personality and are acceding to the Strasbourg Convention .
Tegretol 200 mg
on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , I wish to explain our abstention from the vote on the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance &apos;s amendment on a tax on the model of the Tobin tax .
one of the ways in which we can help is to promote democracy , the rule of law , counter-terrorism policies and cooperation in the region and also in this specific country .
the vote is due to take place at the end of the debates , in other words in just a moment .
in the case of many of the challenges we need to take up , we shall not be able to do so without the scope for action offered by the Treaty of Lisbon - the scope for greater democratisation , namely the reinforcement of the rights of the European Parliament and those of the national parliaments .
( RO ) Mr President , I understand very well the subsidiarity principle , but I believe that pensions have ceased to be a national concern as they are the subject today of an EU-level debate .
first , I have to say that , in its proposals , the Commission has always stressed data protection .
52 .
the second lesson is this : the entire history of the budget shows that legal ceilings , the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act in the US , the rule of 1 % of national income , are all , again , foolishness .
moreover , I would also like to highlight in this freedom agenda the efforts that the Portuguese Presidency made to extend the area of freedom of movement to the new Member States .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance fully supports two points in the resolution .
the report by Pilar del Castillo Vera , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Electronic Communications Market Authority - C6-0428 / 2007 - ,
we must strengthen the fight against illegal immigration by introducing various types of sanctions against the employers of these illegal immigrants at European level .
there is no threat to national constitutions ; it is simply an expression of our desire for more discussion within the euro area in particular , but also in the Europe of 27 .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , fishing is by nature the most globalised of professions and one that confronts globalisation in all its might .
also foreseen is an &apos; impact assessment &apos; in 2008 , to precede the action plan for 2009-2012 , on the basis of a clear timetable .
Europe must shape the international response to international problems .
that is why quality policy in the agri-food sector will be one of the priorities of my mandate , one of my main priorities straight after the common agricultural policy post-2013 reform .
let me conclude by saying that we want to ensure that as many European companies as possible come through the crisis intact .
we believe that this is an implementing act , and the issue should therefore be regulated in this manner , by way of an implementing act .
the Council will definitely study the recommendations contained in the report carefully .
all I would like to do is to warn against untrammelled freedom in an area which affects me and with which I have been entrusted in this House .
we must also remember Parliament &apos;s report on childcare facilities for students , because we are talking about work , but work starts with professional qualifications .
our existing European Neighbourhood Policy is not enough .
we await with interest the Green Paper and the conclusions that it will contain .
the Member States can respond quite differently and far more quickly today to the various new models that appear on the market on a daily basis .
if we fail to create a work-life balance , we will not be able to encourage young mothers to pursue a professional career so that they can attain a management position as well .
Islam and democracy do not mix .
piracy and the illegal distribution of music and films on the Internet are an indisputable reality .
in my home country we have even witnessed the murder of people who have defended human rights .
it seems to be a pretext for the centre-left to attack the right-wing , conservative government of Prime Minister Orban .
( PT ) Ladies and gentlemen , I am convinced that the European Union &apos;s budget for 2010 will help us to overcome the economic crisis that we are undergoing at present .
these ceilings , as you know , are not objectives to be met .
Ms Shirin Ebadi , who has denounced these abuses at great personal risk , and who won the Nobel Peace Prize as a result , continues to do so on behalf of all ethnic groups and all religious communities .
in the matter of transplantation , society must be sure that everything is being done in accordance with the law , transparently and without any hidden interests , and that this noble medical procedure is not being used as a cover for considerations other than that of saving human life .
the Council underlined the importance of investments in innovation , research and in the development of agricultural production and drew attention to the social and environmental impact of bio-fuel production and use within and outside the EU .
the price of oil is currently hitting new records .
in addition , the Union has allocated a budget of EUR 825 million for 2007-2013 to implement the European Fund for the Integration of third-country Nationals .
I do find it surprising , however , that a text which deplores the inadequate health services in developing countries should choose to overlook one of the greatest scandals of our time : the plundering of doctors from these countries by wealthier countries , which have given up training their own doctors sufficiently in the belief that they can cut back on their social protection .
subject : award procedures for public works , public supply , and public service contracts in the field of defence and security
finally , I urge you to vote against the ALDE Group &apos;s frankly scandalous amendment , which seeks to remove the restrictions on access to clean development mechanism and joint implementation project credits , not just for aviation but for all sectors in the ETS .
that would create the necessary openness in Turkey for debate , including debate on issues from the past , and that brings me to the Armenian question .
this is where we should be focusing our efforts .
for this reason , it is essential that cohesion policy continues to support the less developed regions .
we also have a responsibility for them , as they have been the victims of an unparalleled catastrophe : first an earthquake and now a cholera epidemic .
if not , we will at least propose binding legislation .
this should be done in a way which permits the smooth implementation of these rights .
if we divide this 20 % across the various different sectors , such as transport , heating , electricity , industry and agriculture , it is clear that electricity generation is the most important .
I think it is important to highlight the significant role played by the Belgian Presidency , which did what was necessary to reach this difficult compromise with Parliament , and particularly with certain Member States , whose position was - how can I describe it ? - resistant in certain cases .
gay Mitchell spoke very eloquently about the difficulties for the developing world when erosion of biodiversity occurs .
the choice of 25 May is not incidental - it was on that day , in 1948 , that the Soviet authorities murdered cavalry Captain Witold Pilecki , the Polish soldier who voluntarily became a prisoner in the Auschwitz extermination camp in order to build the resistance movement there .
it means that the law of the place where the seat of authority for cross-border cooperation is registered will be applicable , if such an authority has been established .
we must now not throw the baby out with the bathwater , which is what some of the colleagues in this House would like .
above all , as regards the European rules , they prevent the public sector and large companies from distorting the legislation adopted at a national level in the Member States .
it will not be evident until four to six years down the line whether the measures we are now taking are effective .
for far too long PE has been a minor subject , particularly in primary schools , and lessons are often cancelled at the first whiff of rain .
in fact , the same could be said for many of the EU &apos;s agencies , which duplicate work done at national level and unashamedly promote the EU &apos;s federalist agenda .
following the accession of the Czech Republic to the Schengen Information System , Czech citizens were told they had free and unhindered movement within the territory of the EU , including Germany , just as the Schengen System anticipates and guarantees .
he is becoming a presidential candidate in Egypt , as I understand it .
I think we achieved a lot , and I would like once again to commend Ms Ferrero-Waldner , who did the main work in our delegation in the humanitarian sphere , where what we have achieved still works today .
is it not time at this summit to say that we want a strategic dialogue for a strategic partnership ?
we will keep a close watch on the use of the European Arrest Warrant which , to my mind , is one of the best tools that we currently have for judicial cooperation in criminal matters , which clearly needs to be improved still further .
what is important today is that President Obama has made the right decision to close this prison of shame and this decision both speaks well of America and is true to the history of America and of the international community in general .
otherwise , many people could attempt to evade this challenge .
secondly , concerning the whole matter of coordination and civil protection and so on , let me just say three things .
I would also like to draw attention to a deterioration in the situation of many people living near the borders , including the representatives of Polish minorities living there , who , after Poland joined the Schengen Area , have found it very difficult to contact their families living in Poland , especially with the high visa costs .
the statement says quite clearly that if in 2020 the targets are not achieved , this will be a serious indication for the Commission that a Member State has not taken the necessary measures designed to achieve the targets .
ultimately , it is to blame for what happens to it .
( RO ) Together we decided that the European energy policy would aim at decreasing the EU &apos;s energy dependence , guaranteeing the security of supply and the transparency of prices .
( DE ) Madam President , unfortunately , my painful illness has so far prevented me from speaking out as clearly to our international audience as I have done in the past on other European topics .
we cannot accept that there will be isolated areas where equality of opportunity is not consistently applied .
- The debate is closed .
no one is sure who the attackers were .
indeed , as Mr Stevenson has just said , the increase is not being reflected in the price charged by farmers ; they blame the gap between the price paid to them and the price paid by the consumer on a Common Agricultural Policy based on promoting set-aside .
one of the highest priorities was equal-opportunities issues .
the principle of paying for work on time is a fundamental principle of correct behaviour but is also of crucial importance in determining the solidity of an enterprise , its available funds and its access to credit and finance .
these are the implementing Regulation and the text of the Annexes .
the business directory companies are often established in a different Member State from that of their victims , making it difficult for the latter to seek protection and / or redress from national authorities .
this proposal for mobilisation of the EUSF is the first to be presented by the Commission for the year 2011 .
it would make life much easier for companies operating in the field of e-commerce .
if we want to meet the Kyoto Protocol commitments , the countries with a rapidly growing gross domestic product will also have to build large power plants .
the European Commission has also opted for this , on the eve of our pilot projects to achieve carbon capture and storage , for example as a technological innovation .
following several months of debate in Parliament , with the Council and with the Commission , white smoke has finally risen from the negotiations .
indeed , I would take this opportunity to recall in particular the case of the Karen people who have been proudly holding out for decades in defence of their identity , and I would just as resolutely condemn the referendum mechanism enshrined in the constitution which the regime is seeking to impose on Burma .
I was very pleased to hear you say that we need to get closer to our citizens .
the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers , which is to take place later this month , will be very useful here .
the European Union must in no uncertain terms call on the Cambodian Government to respect its commitments .
nevertheless , for the peace and assurance of the citizens of neighbouring Austria , the Slovak Republic agreed during EU accession talks to the early decommissioning of the V1 and V2 reactors at Jaslovské Bohunice , which were fitted out to the highest standards .
I have to say that neither Qimonda management nor employee representatives have approached the Commission .
the House will be aware that my colleague Mr Ashworth &apos;s report on simplification of the CAP was adopted in this House last May .
what is wrong with populism , seeing that parliamentarians are the voice of the populus , the people ?
another fly in the ointment is the poor integration with Eurojust , which should have been the focus of attention .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
on most of the issues the negotiations went well and we agreed on the basic lines of this legislation .
in the meantime , I will continue to monitor and report on behalf of the citizens .
the EU is committed to shouldering its fair share of that , which of course also requires a fair internal burden-sharing agreement .
( ES ) Mr President , exactly eight years ago this November , the Prestige , an oil tanker carrying 70 000 tonnes of crude oil , suffered an accident off the coast of Galicia causing a leak through which the tanker spilled 20 000 tonnes of oil .
only the prevention of conflicts and the implementation of civilian measures in conflict situations are capable of fulfilling the promise made in UN Security Council resolution 1325 .
the first sector concerns humanitarian aid , for which ECHO has already provided EUR 30.5 million in 2007 in the form of emergency aid measures for supporting refugees and displaced persons in different sectors in Chad .
it is an initiative by Mr Kastler , who is present here today , and it calls for Sundays to be kept free as a day of rest and reserved for family and contemplation .
any progress on infrastructure that would allow new-party access is very slow because vertically integrated monopolies invest mainly to further consolidate their domination , while it is hard to attract new investors to a closed market .
coming back to the question of carbon liquids , this is not only a question of preserving our jobs , employment and competitiveness , but also an environmental question .
therefore , in strict application of the provisions of Rule 147 , the President is of the opinion that they fulfil all the relevant admissibility criteria .
that means that ecological issues and criteria , too , represent a key element in the prosperity of regions .
in view of this , I would like to be given clearer information about how you view the structure of relations between the rotating Presidency , the Commission , Parliament and the Presidency of the Council .
for the funds themselves , this will mean stability and reduce the risk of setbacks .
sadly , I have to report that the negotiations have not been productive , and therefore I am recommending to the House today that we do not vote and that we refer the decision on this important dossier to the next Parliament , when I expect the Commission to produce a new proposal in the autumn of this year .
but before we do that , let us remind ourselves of the importance of services .
both loan rates and demands for collateral should reduce the moral damage that such a belief could create .
furthermore , even some of those who support PNR data transfer think we should , today , make a political demonstration and show the Council its place in the pecking order - in a word , to punish the Council for its arrogance .
from the first days of the aviation problem , Parliament set to work on the reorganisation of transport to Strasbourg , and I would therefore also like to offer sincere thanks on behalf of those who cannot be here today .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have now been debating the subject of Turkmenistan for three-and-a-half years in various committees in this House .
when it comes to the definition of on-call time , the Council &apos;s objective is often misunderstood .
I wonder what the President-in-Office thinks are the blockages at the moment , within the European Council of Ministers , that are preventing progress being made .
and I think EURES could have an information role in two ways : to those who are trying to move to other labour markets but also to all of us and the Member States in order to make it much easier in reality to move .
perhaps that is what this was actually all about , hence the rejection of the benchmarking method .
the EBRD has taken a proactive stance in response to the crisis : supporting our clients in countries of operations , we are expanding our instruments , and aim to invest EUR 7 billion in 2009 - an increase of more than 20 % .
it is a crisis that affects both our nations and the idea of civilisation that is shared by all Europeans and that unites Europe .
to conclude the debate , I have received one motion for resolution pursuant to Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
it seemed for a while that it might not happen .
these expectations are aimed at the last few months of your term of office and maybe even beyond .
are there any objections ?
this would be an excellent opportunity for cooperation on technology transparency .
however , I hope that everyone who has been involved in this process has learnt some lessons along the way concerning the principles of better regulation .
the &apos; Blue Card &apos; and circular migration are an initial step in the right direction .
secondly , we are very pleased about the point you mentioned with regard to the electronic management of the process , but the key issue in our view is whether service providers can ultimately carry out all the tasks required under the procedure in a simple and effective way using the online process and whether , behind these many home pages , they will actually find people they can talk to about the matter and about the requirements in the Member States , or whether we are not simply constructing walls and barriers here .
Mr President , I would just like to add my voice of support to that of colleagues on all sides of this House about the appalling story of the treatment of albinos in Tanzania .
the state of play of the Euromed Free Trade Area ( vote )
the Commission believes that its recent proposal for a directive would be a more suitable instrument to achieve our common objective of protecting children from child sex offenders .
as regards the use of security officers on board aircrafts , each Member State has the competence to decide on the registered and authorised aircraft in the Member State in question , but their role was improved by the enforcement of certain provisions on the training and security terms imposed thereon .
the focus is on two budget lines : competitiveness and the environment .
if , however , it had reservations in interpreting the draft recommendation , it was obliged , in order to justify its decisions , to submit equally strong legal assessments confirming the possibility that the automobile manufacturer in question might take recourse to the courts on the basis of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 of the European Parliament .
it has happened again because most governments bought into the fairytale that global markets could be self-regulating , and failed to apply democratic controls to the market .
on the other hand there are matters that only concern specific industries .
Europe must be the main witness to what is the rule of law .
yes , many bad things are happening in Africa .
we need a two-thirds majority constitution because this is a rule that provides guarantees .
we hope that they will be able to be adopted by the end of the parliamentary term , and this , in particular , thanks to the commitment made by the Czech Presidency .
composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
we also support the proposal from Elisabeth Jeggle in favour of creating a EUR 600 million dairy fund and the extension of the school milk programme .
its protection is therefore crucial to the preservation of our cultural heritage and natural resources .
therefore , there is no doubt that the constant increase in food prices as a result of increased commodity prices is an increasingly pressing concern for the EU .
even with the amendments we voted on today , it still is an unacceptable violation of the principle of subsidiarity .
now my opinion has become official : the EU &apos;s own monitoring system has not - as I suspected - turned out to be a placebo , a sedative for critics , within the space of a few years , but rather after just a few months .
Mr President , may I offer the EU some modest advice ?
Mr President , I welcome the adoption of this report .
we believe we have made considerable progress , not least in terms of the electronic means of communication , which hopefully will speed up the process for all citizens , but we in Parliament believe that we have added to citizens &apos; rights within this process , that they are now entitled to much more information , not least in the case of those who have been posted for work purposes .
the adopted amendments somewhat improve the Council &apos;s proposal .
now it is about EUR 270 per tonne , and it is profitable to produce .
however , the limited ability of SMEs to access finance is a major impediment to their creation and growth , particularly faced with the current financial and economic crisis .
the debate is closed .
with respect to the rights of MEPs , if a committee submits proposals for a decision in Plenary , it is not for the Parliamentary Services , or any other bodies , to decide whether these proposals are right or wrong .
it is a rare moment when a legislative authority or an executive transfers some of its powers to the citizens .
( applause )
but , as the Commissioner pointed out , there are 19 participating Member States in this project .
unfortunately , they are only empty words , for the constitution is not respected .
what has been condemned is the possibility of setting interbank margins unilaterally , arbitrarily and without consultation , when these rightly appear excessive .
what I mean is that , while the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) refused us an urgent debate on Uganda about the laws against homosexuals and another urgent debate on Iran about the executions being carried out there , they would now like us to get involved in the game of being for or against Ortega , with the demonstrations going on over there .
it is essential in this context that Member States really do fulfil their tasks .
let us not beat about the bush .
promoting access to the labour market and good quality jobs were key priorities of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs and of the European Youth Pact .
it is also clear that a debate urgently needs to take place on the necessity of new resources for the Union budget .
I believe that it is important that this area be regulated in a unified manner .
until October , the Coordination Cell will continue to play its supporting role towards the Member States to try to improve the security conditions in the area .
a couple of weeks ago , I sent Mr Barroso a letter on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe expressing our concern and asking why we no longer have a Commissioner for Communication .
we avoided a rather unwise discussion on whether neighbourliness with the East is more important , or neighbourliness with the South .
the intention seems to be not to tighten the regulations , but simply to design a system which is slightly less prone to breaking down .
the PPE Group encourages you to come up with ambitious proposals and you will be able to count on our support here in Parliament .
many ask whether a country the size of Sweden can shoulder this responsibility .
by Mrs Von Thun und Hohenstein , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on the Internal Market Scoreboard ( SEC ( 2009 ) / 1007 - , and
we also suggest that the budget include the exact amount of these pensions , and not just the amounts paid , as the latter do not take account of the amounts paid into future pensions .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , as the Irish Prime Minister sets out for Brussels tomorrow , he might well chew over the words of the Irish pop group U2 : &apos; where did it all go wrong ? &apos;
such actions are necessary in order to limit further additions to the global pool of this highly toxic heavy metal .
I understood from what you said , Mr Lehne , that the crisis was caused by the socialists in Europe .
in writing . - ( PL ) In taking the floor during this debate on climate protection policy up to 2050 , I would like to draw your attention to the following points .
( ES ) Mr President , in this time of crisis , in which we find ourselves , there are two main types of policies and actions : preventive policies and actions and stimulative policies and actions .
( DE ) Mr President , as far as our oceans are concerned , time is running out .
the compromises that we wanted with the Council were rejected .
we need a social development and progress pact that aims at production , particularly in the fields of agriculture and industry , at employment with rights and social inclusion , instead of coming back to insist upon the Stability Pact , with its liberalisations and neoliberal diktats , as the President of the Council has done .
in terms of the temporary &apos; tie-up &apos; measures , I would like reassurances from the Commissioner that these will apply to all those who have to tie up for a short time for economic reasons , and that the restriction that they will only be available to those who are part of the restructuring scheme will be applied with the broadest interpretation .
you will be strengthening Europe &apos;s role as a leader in the global policy against anthropogenic carbon emissions , which also augurs well for the international negotiations in Poznań in December 2008 and Copenhagen in December 2009 .
I voted in favour of the report .
I voted in favour of the report on university-business dialogue because , in my opinion , it is essential that the link between training and the labour market should be improved .
in these circumstances , it seems paradoxical that increasingly fewer companies are opting for rail transport .
I believe that we can take the initiative in starting this dialogue .
on average , over the three disciplines in the 25 EU countries for which data is available , 22.5 % were low achievers in 2006 and , by 2009 , their share had declined to 19.6 % .
the policy of supporting a European perspective for all the Western Balkan countries , agreed on that occasion , has since been reaffirmed , most recently by the Council at its meeting of 8 December 2008 .
I just wonder whether you have remembered what happened to the last 10-year plan , which was launched in 2000 .
this is why I think that we need to both assign more specialised staff in this area and raise the participation level of local actors in the project .
this would make a steering policy possible .
we will have to properly think through how we do that in the future so that Parliament can send its own message sooner to the Commission .
this is what should have been taken into account in this motion for a resolution .
finally , I would like to turn to external relations .
I am also apprehensive about what will happen as regards movement of capital when the common tax base is established .
the aim of the EU must therefore be to keep Ukraine on the Union &apos;s radar screen .
in other words , we support the flexible , pragmatic position which was approved in the Council and proposed by the European Commission on excluding the self-employed from the directive .
Mr President , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to vote in favour of this alternative resolution .
closure of sitting
firstly , they have both recognised Africa &apos;s enormous potential perhaps more - or in any case sooner - than anyone else .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
( RO ) As a representative of Romanian citizens , I believe that it is extremely important that the European Parliament takes part in the decision-making process concerning the protection of personal data collected in the context of law enforcement .
corrigendum ( Rule 216 ) : see Minutes
these initiatives were appreciated but inadequate .
as an integrated strategy , it is , in principle , not bad , but ...
we saw passengers being left stranded at destinations , without accommodation or even a flight home .
this long-awaited directive , whose history is just as complicated throughout the consultations in Parliament , is based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty and governs protection against discrimination , emphasising equality of treatment whatever the grounds .
aid funds from Hungary originally intended for Burma were redirected to China due to the isolationist attitude of the Burmese military dictatorship .
pursuant to Rule 168 , the ALDE Group would like to make a request for referral back to committee .
the strengthening of democracy in this country must be one of the priorities of the European Union in its neighbourhood policy .
we may be talking today more about antibiotics and the growing resistance to them , but we must take note of the issue and assess it more comprehensively .
this has resulted in a lack of legal clarity , which I deeply regret .
in a nutshell , Bosnia and Herzegovina today needs urgently to overcome the current political stalemate , to move seriously towards the European Union .
we are building , in these circumstances , democracy at gunpoint .
in writing . - UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU &apos;s attempts to invade and regulate this network .
such a measure will help to eradicate poverty and enable older people to live in dignity .
the US financial system with its investment banks , hedge funds and structured products , which are not subject to normal banking supervision , and its numerous business operations conducted through single-purpose companies which do not appear in any balance sheet , has virtually collapsed .
( the President cut off the speaker . )
it is important that , as more VPAs are agreed , their effects are closely monitored and that their terms take full account of the needs and human rights of people who are dependent on forests , but who often do not have a voice in the management of those forests .
perhaps data like this on the scale of the whole EU will make it clear to the decision-makers that there is a need to limit subsidies allocated to a single farm so that these subsidies help family farms more than large estates .
the impact of austerity measures in some countries , such as Portugal , Greece and Ireland , is having repercussions for the lives of women as workers , citizens and mothers .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , anyone who has ever seen the Great Lakes region of East Africa from the air might think that it was paradise .
I think he put a very good point forward there .
I sincerely wish our Croatian friends well in rapidly concluding the final chapters and in being capable of confirming , through a popular vote , their readiness to become part of the European Community .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have many reservations about this report , the first of which , as was said a short time ago , concerns a provision that seems baffling at a time when Europe is facing the problem of the wages guarantee fund or indeed the redundancies of millions of workers .
why can we not be more realistic with regard to the Structural Funds ?
Member States should ratify and apply conventions which the ILO considers to be currently in force .
it was all about nuances : does the reminder of international law and the ban on altering the borders of a neighbouring country by force constitute a sanction ?
&apos;Stop Barroso - go for a green new deal &apos; : this is more than ever the right slogan for the upcoming European elections .
on the campaign trail , the voters ask us outright . where is Europe ?
bilateral agreements may not contain elements such as judicial redress on a non-discriminatory basis , rectification and erasure and a prohibition on data mining and profiling .
Mr President , one of the first speeches I made in this House 23 years ago was on the then proposal for a Toy Safety Directive .
in acting in this way , and in taking note of the assurances given with regard to the lasting and fair nature of the arrangements made in the &apos; Two-plus-Four &apos; Process , the Community remained true to the values for which it stands : peace , mutual understanding between peoples , and solidarity , especially with all Germans in the East and in the West .
more than ever we have to avoid divisions between Member States - to avoid categorisation of old and new , big and small .
they are much less costly than private actions as consumers will be compensated for the losses suffered much more quickly .
we know it creates jobs and competitiveness .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this report because I believe that at this moment in time , we need to explore innovative financing mechanisms .
we need to be very careful about replacing an unhealthy but highly competitive industry with a cartel based on market-sharing and price-fixing , as what we try to rescue will end up in a worse situation .
it promotes the free movement of researchers between states , the public and private sectors , companies , research centres and universities , greater cohesion between the private and public sectors in the field of research , the absolute subjugation of science to the market &apos;s temporary technological requirements and the orientation of researchers towards applied research , recognising previous experience as a corporate researcher as a formal qualification .
the next item is the report by Mr Csibi , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy related products ( recast ) - C6-0277 / 2008 - .
in addition , it is silent about the repression of workers , trade unionists and leftist forces in Turkey , as well as of the Kurdish minority .
though I acknowledge that Member States need to engage in the funding of research and development for the automobile sector in this area , I feel that the industry itself should also contribute and demonstrate a further commitment to reducing the effects of climate change .
I believe that the relevant rules should provide guidance to officials as to how they should ensure both sound financial management and good administration .
where is the other sixty-odd percent ?
close cooperation is undoubtedly needed in order to combat illegal immigration .
fisheries agreements with third countries , particularly in the pelagic segment of the EU fleet , are of strategic importance , and not only for the maintenance of the fleet itself .
why ?
in 2006 the Ombudsman carried out 582 inquiries in total , of which 315 were already under way in 2005 and nine were launched on the Ombudsman &apos;s own initiative .
those responsible for this delay , and the advocates of this approach , which has placed Europe in a situation of extreme insecurity and recession , include you , Mr Barroso , you and the majority of your Commission .
in writing . - UKIP voted against Amendments 1 and 29 so as to restore the Commission &apos;s intention to exclude independent drivers from this directive .
because of the dominance of US film , which commands a huge market , European film has a tougher job competing in the world market , despite the fact that it has far more qualities than many a US tear-jerker or blockbuster .
the Commission is seeking to secure a level playing field throughout the world for our fisheries and the fisheries that produce the products we are obliged to import .
that is why I support Amendment 38 tabled by Mrs Lichtenberger , which adds certain enhancements to the Commission &apos;s text .
we maintained the same position , in the expectation that there would in effect be more transparency .
I have already pointed out , however , that the Commission believes that there are opportunities for improvement here and what we want to achieve with Liechtenstein - as with other countries - is completely clear .
( RO ) This report refers to the environmental issues , but it cannot and could not have referred only to environmental issues .
as regards the amendments tabled to our proposal for a Council regulation , we all have to keep in mind that the discussions were very lively in the Council .
particularly unacceptable is the continued under representation of citizens of the new Member States , including Poland , and not only in the European Union &apos;s civil service .
that there is a great deal of chaos and disorder there is easy to imagine .
we are nevertheless going to try to enable everyone to speak , among other things , until the President arrives , as he has stepped out for a moment and I am replacing him on an impromptu basis .
I am curious as to whether Slovenian citizens , as well as those living in the smaller Member States , would now receive suitable assistance if they applied to the French consulates in those countries .
Madam President , the report we are today debating has turned the current Posting of Workers Directive into a challenge for collective agreements .
we should certainly take a positive view of the way the Turkish authorities have dealt with issues related to religious freedom , women &apos;s rights , trade union rights , judicial reform , revision of radio and TV legislation and improvements in civil-military relations .
we would like to see the Commission proposing the scrapping of degressive capping and addressing the issue of direct payments in a more radical way .
in particular , I welcome the intention to launch a major reform of Canada &apos;s fisheries management system , also involving the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation .
it is not a question of knowing whether a dialogue will be held with Hamas , but of knowing how it will be held , and under what conditions .
is there a proposal to set up a coordination unit that will be permanently operable at some central point to help coordinate these cross-border natural disasters that have an impact right across the Union ?
I agree with one of the Namibian politicians who said that , besides the traditional diseases that Africa has to grapple with - like malaria , tuberculosis and AIDS - the most dangerous disease today , the one that needs to be tackled with the greatest urgency , is Mugabeism .
it must be your job to coordinate the Member States in areas where the powers of the European Commission and the Union are inadequate .
therefore , in my capacity as Member of this Parliament , I voted in favour of this report .
the directive on compliance with flag State requirements was an attempt to extend EU competence to an area in which there are already UN rules .
this is an exercise that is unmasking itself as it goes through the obvious contradictions that it contains , not least in making use of an alleged defending of human rights to promote intervention in countries where its own interests are at stake , whitewashing its allies and supporting them , particularly the United States .
the United States is accusing Airbus of enjoying the advantage of large subsidies and beneficial credits from EU Member State governments .
we are therefore making efforts to improve them .
some have been removed from office ; others have left the country .
we must also ensure a greater level of joint responsibility amongst Member States , not just for the benefits , but also for the obligations and commitment which stem from the Stability and Growth Pact .
the availability of &apos; Europeana &apos; should be improved ensuring free-of-charge access for pupils , students and teachers in secondary schools , universities and other educational institutions .
in the last few days you have been sending out your messengers on horseback with the following message : &apos; moi , J &apos;ai la majorité , I have the majority &apos; .
the decisions taken in these last few days pushing us towards super austerity , and the Commission setting itself up as a veritable tribunal to put it into effect , are in conflict with every single social project .
for this reason , I congratulate Mrs Jäätteenmäki for having struck an appropriate balance between these two requirements and for having proposed balanced solutions that strengthen the effectiveness of the role of the Ombudsman as a moral authority and improve the transparency of the Community institutions , confirming , in the spirit of the new Charter , the right of every European citizen to good governance and a good administration .
as for the creation of a new website and the establishment of links with local television stations , I would like to say that the Commission is in the process of creating networks of radio and television operators that will broadcast programmes on European issues .
most importantly , I think it is very important to see what can be specific deliverables for Cancún .
they can take account of the different industry interests , and they can interpret the Community interest in different ways .
finally , I would of course like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for their comments and assistance when drafting this report .
the Commission can accept Amendments 3 , 12 , 14 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 38 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 72 and 73 .
our industry cannot and must not fall victim to a strong European currency .
it is work carried out in the home - childcare and elderly-care facilities - that is included in the Europe 2020 strategy and represents 5 % to 9 % of all work undertaken in the EU , with the trend being towards growth .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I much appreciated the willingness of the Commission and also of the Council to reach an interinstitutional political agreement quickly in view of the new transitions we will be experiencing in the next few months .
the debate is closed .
the air carriers are telling us the same .
the objective is to achieve a more predictable and more stable world banana market with a view to more investment and growth in the sector and putting an end to a decades-old conflict based on complaints against the EU when it introduced changes to customs duties applicable to bananas in 2006 .
a strategy could be arrived at through concrete measures on how the EU deals with a multitude of local organisations ; on physically linking the area to the rest of the continent in which the River Danube is crucial ; and on strengthening the instrument of neighbourhood policy towards the Black Sea area , as suggested through my group &apos;s amendments .
perhaps some people thought that Parliament would become more amenable after the elections in June , or that Parliament &apos;s demands for openness and transparency smacked of election promises rather than a real change of attitude .
non-governmental organisations have submitted complaints relating to the creation of illegal and secret databases for storing personal information in connection with racial and ethnic origins , and have stated that they are appealing to the relevant authorities .
commercial considerations took precedence .
another item within the budget review , the question of flexibility , for example , will be a topic that we must debate .

I have voted in favour of the report on naming and labelling textile products .
among other aspects mentioned here , the summit failed as regards funding for the so-called &apos; adaptation &apos; for developing countries , due to the insufficient number of those who made commitments .

for this reason , both my group and I support this directive , because it represents an important step on the part of Parliament ; one that will have a beneficial effect on the lives of the people of Europe .

in this sense , this compromise is a good one .
I think it has been important to have this discussion and I recognise there are some very useful avenues to pursue .

the outcome of Lisbon follows an approach that I endorse , but I do not think that the reasons for the changes will serve Europe &apos;s future .
Member States must improve the adequacy of pensions by combating gender discrimination on the labour market , especially through a 10 % reduction in the pay gap by 2020 .
use us as much as you can because we are writing today the next report for the common foreign and security policy and because the exceptional dynamic activity going on in 2011 gives us a chance to put our own house in order .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the real danger does not come from well serviced nuclear reactors , but from nuclear reactors under the wrong political control .
we - as Europeans , as states and as Parliament - are being asked to face up to this issue and have been asked to do so , ladies and gentlemen , not just for a few years now , but for a very long time .
given the large amounts of money which both banks handle and allocate in the form of loans , it is crucial that they work according to clear criteria and principles .
Mr Vigenin , could you answer that ?
we need to understand , however , that certain steps have to be taken and that there is an imbalance between the scale of our political activities , our economic activities and the extent of compliance with standard fundamental rights .
its potential is far greater .
I was actually in Sri Lanka for a delegation visit .
we cannot at this time forget that , depending on social attitudes , it would be possible for strongly anti-European forces to come to power .
during this debate , Mr Schulz expressed the view that I should inform the European Parliament .
therefore , the Commission must respond now .
in addition , I would like to add my voice to the appeal of my political group for the unconditional release of the imprisoned journalists and adequate revision of Azerbaijani law .
Mr President , this is my first opportunity in my capacity as a member of the Council Presidency to stand before this Chamber and , on behalf of the Swedish Presidency and the whole of the Council and also myself personally , I would like to congratulate you most sincerely Mr President .
( SL ) Madam President , when the revolution that is currently taking place in the streets of Cairo ends , the Egyptian people will choose a political system and their leaders .
I myself spoke about the need for Europe to keep its commitments so that we could be credible .
I think , however , that the agreement is a good one and that we will be able to adopt it tomorrow without any problems .
I would like to know whether you believe that the non-uniform , relatively low upper limits on liability are really what we need in the light of the catastrophe in the Gulf .
for this reason we need to call on Member States to participate in this initiative and to allocate appropriate human and financial resources for this purpose .
these include almost 50 countries whose people are suffering from the effects of successive failures to implement the recommendations of successive United Nations conferences .
there is no doubt , then , about the importance of the objectives set out in the agreement .
this is a further important reason for supporting the report .
the people of Europe deserve nothing less .
we are calling for a new Europe to be built , a free Europe of sovereign nations that will establish privileged relations with Russia .
things often get broken .
does the European Commission intend to reconsider its policy in this sector in the light of Parliament &apos;s resolution of 13 March 2007 so that a global approach may be found that takes into account not only the interests of the users but also the interests of the licence holders and of the creative community ?
once the region presents a coherent waste management plan , the European Union will release the funds .
it is also very important to guarantee full transparency in connection with , and a strong political commitment to , the implementation of the fast-start financing .
he keeps promising that if he wins a general election he is going to have a referendum if the Treaty has not been ratified by 27 Member States .
the resolution does a very good job of presenting a dynamic situation , full of possibilities for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
for this purpose , we will be organising a demographics week with the involvement of NGOs and with an informal meeting of ministers for family affairs .
( DA ) Mr President , I voted against this budget report , but I would actually like to thank the many fellow Members - a few too many , unfortunately - who voted in favour , because it gave a wonderful picture of the shift in the perception of reality here in the European Parliament and here in the EU &apos;s institutions in relation to the outside world where the people who we are actually creating regulations for are to be found .
the Committee on the Environment would therefore like its timetable to have been respected , which would allow for a thorough debate to be held on the issue and for Parliament to adopt a position .
it firstly concerns the substance and secondly the procedure , and I will repeat some of what has already been very well expressed by all the political groups .
I am in favour of postponing the decision on releasing the implementation of the EU general budget for the year 2008 in the interests of transparency and rigour , not only in terms of implementing the budget , but also the complete supervision of the use of all the EU &apos;s financial resources .
so when there was a choice to be made in my report on novel foods , in the first instance I opted for food safety , consumer welfare , the environment and animal welfare .
it may grant a concession to users which open new routes ... in accordance with EC competition law ...
we are well aware of the gradual slippage of investment products .
many women continue to be concentrated in a narrow range of occupations , in part-time and low-paid work , and in jobs where their skills and contributions are undervalued .
we were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism - and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that .
tourism offers significant potential for social and economic development , as well as for social and territorial cohesion .
the pledge recently made by the Commission and the Member States to earmark almost EUR 500 million is certainly a big and significant step in this direction , and we should all stand behind it .
every generation has its own challenges , so they say .
it is deplorable that this resolution failed to win the vote of the House as the socialist position supported the interests of European citizens .
in essence , it is vital that Europe does not forget or turn its back on all the women who are not already ensured a future of freedom and hope .
this destruction had an obvious purpose : to remove all evidence that this town was inhabited by people of Greek culture and the Christian faith .
for some reason , we have witnessed a wave of unprecedented general strikes all over Europe .
I also approve the idea that implementation of the Directive may increase the rate of waste processed and reported , particularly with regard to the collection rate , responsibility for achieving the collection target and the responsibility of consumers .
patients need to be absolutely sure that the medicines they consume really are the medicines they expect them to be .
of course , we would then need two different dossiers , so that any emergency action necessary could be taken rapidly and so that we could make sure there was enough time for a comprehensive review .
in addition , you have also very generously created a budget line to encourage Member States to create these mechanisms , or at least to create links between themselves to deal with &apos; kidnap alerts &apos; .
the European Commission , in its communication on the renewed social agenda , states : &apos; the Commission calls upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO conventions that are up to date &apos; .
it is essential that sanctions affect as little as possible the population of countries whose political regions are subject to sanctions .
the European Union &apos;s consumer policy is a fundamental component in consolidating the internal market .
we also think that the whole proposal should be approved by codecision , under Article 199 of the Treaty .
the reference to the fact that this needs to be regulated at a global level is familiar from the climate debate .
I am not surprised that ordinary , decent Irish citizens are confused , because they have strange bedfellows on the &apos; no &apos; side - Ms McDonald and Mr Farage .
action taken on Parliament &apos;s positions and resolutions : see Minutes
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , in the debate that we are going to have - I hope - we will be asking for an independent inquiry into the mass graves , for those sites to be protected and for an end to the harassment of the people carrying out this inquiry .
these measures adopted in the short , medium and long term by the EU are clearly taking the Union along a path towards economic union .
we in the June List advocate a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon in Sweden .
we are working with social partners , because we believe that is also part of our model in Europe -the idea to work together with our social partners - and we believe that in this way we can help our workers to prepare them for the jobs of the future sustainable and low carbon economy that we want European to lead .
fourth point : while , on the one hand , large trade deficits are driven by excessive spending and indebtedness in some Member States , including the United States of America , on the other hand , large export-driven economies in certain emerging countries are experiencing trade surpluses .
as shown in the debate in the specialist committee itself and in the alternative proposals which it presents , there is a power struggle going on here between the Commission and the Council .
these are the sectors associated with the greatest geopolitical risk .
as the full impact on consumers of the specific forms of gambling services offered online is not yet known , we need to take urgent action to fill this knowledge gap .
that must be one of the results of Copenhagen .
this is not the case here .
in particular , we must remember small and medium-sized enterprises , which not only provide jobs for most of our citizens , but also possess huge potential for innovation .
if we were to go down that road , there would be no more investment in this sector .
the Commissioner also made a comparison with minced meat but we know that the hygiene standards for minced meat are not the same as for prepared meat products , so I would question if both statements by the Commissioner are correct .
in Poland , the opinion of the German Chancellor is much more important than that of Mr Van Rompuy , and the loudly resounding voice of Mr Cameron is more important than the opinion of Mr Barroso .
is the Commission prepared to suspend the ban on conventional light bulbs , at least for private households ?
I sincerely hope that the &apos; Pierre de Coubertin &apos; Action Plan that forms part of the White Paper will be taken seriously by the Member States and that the Commission will provide the necessary guidance and , where appropriate , economic assistance from the development funds at its disposal .
Mr Barroso , it is right that we must regulate the financial markets and put safety nets in place .
in recent years the differences between the Member States have been reducing but at the same time the differences inside the individual Member States have become much deeper .
I feel that a key role in this can be played by better legal regulation , including an investigation into the impact on minors of the new and existing rules .
if you fulfil the conditions , you are allowed to proceed with accession and eventually join the European Union .
nothing !
he will probably have to spend quite some time in negotiating with representatives of both the parties but I think it is important that he has our support as well as the support of the other American states for these particular efforts .
of course , it is never too late and with this revision we are at least ensuring that the funds can be used to the full and hopefully will also very quickly reach those who are most affected in the best possible way .
we need to take care that doubt is not cast over the entire statistical system and over Eurostat &apos;s ability to verify the budget data which the Member States provide .
if he wishes to make a comment in relation to those reports , I should be interested to listen .
that is why I would warn against making any decisions before the International Criminal Court in The Hague rules on this matter .
using objective methods and a wide-ranging gathering of testimonies , the Goldstone report exposed these atrocities and itemised which rules of international law Israel contravened by this brutal action .
Ms Weber said that the protection of sources under the Hungarian media law is insufficient .
why do we continue to use it to torment our citizens , by depriving them of work and a livelihood ?
even the inactive part of on-call time cannot be considered in whole or in part to be a rest period , as the Council demanded .
that has led to an erosion of trust in institutions , in leaders , and among neighbours .
what scientific and financial reliability should be accorded to these evaluation reports ?
it is essential that we consider the situation of women who have entered Europe and are being held in detention centres .
I am delighted with the result achieved , therefore .
I would just like briefly to explain why .
I am glad , when we discuss matters arising from the Lisbon Strategy , that it represents a comprehensive approach to sustainable economic development , economic growth , environmental responsibility and socially responsible policy .
let us hope that the referendum will bring the conflict to an end and that we are finally entering into a process for a lasting peace .
firstly , the political context .
these steps are significant in the Belarus context .
I ask you , what happened to the founding myth of the European idea , in this case ?
there is also concern that they may reduce competitiveness in this sector .
I expect the Commission to include in its forward-looking legislative proposal on the future of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) efficient market instruments and the necessary funding to ensure that the feed and cereal market remains stable and to guarantee livestock farmers the security to plan for the future .
a number of us contributed to that effort .
we have thus strengthened the Commission &apos;s proposal by broadening the definition of vulnerable categories and adding issues such as meeting the needs of families with specific problems , single-parent families and large families , addressing the specific problems of people with disabilities and the homeless , and promoting active integration and access to culture and recreation .
we are over-regulating ourselves out of the marketplace .
how hypocritical that the EU should show interest in the rights of children while its policy is crushing workers with unemployment , partial employment , a fall in living standards , the privatisation of health and education , and the commercialisation of sport and culture .
I would like to formally state that the European Commission is fully committed to respecting the principles of the autonomy and independence of the board , which are enshrined in the regulation , and it will not have any role in the EIT &apos;s strategic decision-making .
( FR ) Application of the regulatory procedure
I therefore believe that the debate that we are holding this evening is a just , useful and democratic debate and one which must provide evidence of effective action .
my second question relates to the consultation document itself and the largely negative response to agriculture .
it was essential to resist the proposal to subsume development policy as part of our foreign policy .
we need to examine and compare the control mechanisms available to the European Union and the Member States .
well , dynamic economic modernisation and participation in the Eastern Partnership policy may help to carry out that task .
we wanted revenues for forest protection and enhancement and we wanted clear performance standards for new power stations so that no coal-fired power stations could be opened without a CO2 capture technology in place .
it is a disadvantage that what is referred to as the second pillar - rural development - has been curtailed in medium-term financial planning and has had to come to terms with cutbacks of more than EUR 20 billion according to the Commission &apos;s proposal and that of Parliament .
14 .
I trust that the Safer Internet programme will indeed successfully tackle these problems .
( Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )
the tourism sector is of great importance to European enterprises and to the economies of Member States .
in more general terms , guidelines are needed , precisely to have a strong Agency , in line with the position in the reports by Mr Chichester and Mr Vidal-Quadras .
unfortunately you have people for and people against at European level .
at a time when , in all our countries , we have serious concerns about energy security , and Turkey is in such a key geographical position in providing the routes for pipelines from the Caspian , why is the energy chapter not open ?
it is not negotiable .
( RO ) I very warmly welcome the measures put forward by the Commission and Council .
high Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the Commission . - Thank you all again for an important and interesting debate .
I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for improving this outlook and for managing to give the text of this strategy a very positive direction .
( FI ) Madam President , I think it is very important that we should try and have health claims on products , but it is right that we need to ensure that they are true and based on knowledge .
I wish to commend this Stockholm Programme , which will boost the ambitious political efforts to enhance this area by 2014 .
firstly , security of supply - and this has been achieved .
mark my words : the problem is here to stay .
moreover , the changes themselves will be good for Turkey .
the dumping and the subsidisation were investigated on the basis of complaints by the company concerned and , according to the basic regulations , complainants can withdraw their complaints .
the policy set out there constitutes a response to commitments made in the European Consensus on Development with regard to gender equality in all our cooperation policies and practices .
in order to prepare them for life and society , schools should guide them toward lifelong learning , a comprehensive European Union programme , which sees people able to learn at all ages , thus remaining lively and active members of society .
the question of banking secrecy has therefore been dealt with at European level from a legal point of view and cannot constitute an obstacle to the full exchange of information on request between tax authorities .
they must stimulate the creation of new jobs , while maintaining a long-term , sustainable fiscal policy .
the decision made by the Belarusian authorities to terminate the mission of the OSCE Office is regrettable .
you are depriving them of both .
in fact , with the entry in force of the new Treaty , responsibility for the protection of investments passes from the Member States to the Union .
I would suggest that at the demonstration to be held in front of Parliament on Wednesday , the day we vote , they sit down for a chat with a few workers .
we are going to have to move over to a system of own resources no matter what .
in writing . - ( PT ) This report covers several important issues and makes some findings which we support .
OK , it was not their fault , but apparently the fault of others .
as we have already heard , a visa costs EUR 60 , which is equivalent to the weekly salary of an average Belarusian citizen .
given , on the one hand , the growing child obesity rates in the EU 27 , and on the other hand , the importance of life-long health as the EU population ages , the inclusion of sport as an EU competence under Lisbon is to be welcomed .
market policy will be upheld there too .
but it must mean - if we want to remain credible - that we will do both : energy policy , but also human rights policy , and improving the human rights situation in these countries .
( FR ) Mr President , there are indeed times when one has to know which side to choose .
we must move right away from the false dilemma between solidarity and competitiveness because they are not incompatible .
this can be dealt with at a regional level .
it really is the case - and a few questions can be linked to this - that almost half of all the pre-registration applications were submitted in the last two weeks of the pre-registration period , that is to say , more than one million in the last two weeks .
it is unacceptable to see that some individuals , extremists , choose to use violence and even terrorism and do so in the name of god or in the name of a religion , claiming thereby to speak on behalf of others or even seeking to be above the law and thus associating countless innocent people with this violence .
Mr President , for any strategy to be effective , creating strong links between its objectives and available policy tools is , in my view , essential , and I see four main policy tools as delivery mechanisms for the EU 2020 strategy .
I ask the Commission to pay special attention to SMEs and to provide equitable and non-discriminatory competitive conditions for them .
I would like to ask the Commissioner to take action on this issue .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to say that , for me , the fight for equality between men and women has nothing to do with the Left or Right ; it is not a fight by men or by women ; it is a fight for society as a whole .
as I said at the beginning of the debate , a turning point has come in the history of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the arms control process .
the situation ended in the death of people who were exercising their right to free expression .
I understand Parliament &apos;s position .
we must therefore learn a lesson from the situation .
in my opinion , publishing the &apos; blacklist &apos; of fraudulent uses of EU funds would also pre-empt possible cases of abuse and so promote openness and transparency in the use of EU resources .
it does so with special reservations and severely restricts the scope of such acts .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks for the constructive comments at the end , and above all for the constructive cooperation .
first , we very often content ourselves with condemnation and making ineffective visa bans , which are ridiculously weak instruments .
are there not perhaps one or two things that can yet be done in the realm of state supervision ?
thirteen pacifist groups , such as Bethlehem and Breaking the Silence , are the victims of a veritable witch-hunt .
as Avril Doyle said , we simply cannot understand why these amendments are inadmissible .
( the sitting was closed at 6 p.m. )
the intention is to prevent budget deficits and excessive debt occurring , and to promote the surveillance and coordination of economic policy , so supporting the achievement of the Union &apos;s objectives regarding growth and jobs .
we need to ensure fair competition and refuse to allow our efforts to address climate change to become a disadvantage in terms of world trade .
too many villages have been burnt down in the Balkans in the past decade .
Member of the Commission . - Well , we always follow facts .
we are , in fact , starting to see some significant signs of improvement in certain economic indicators , particularly in the growth of international trade and in the confidence of consumers and investors .
at Community level , industry generates 26.4 % of GDP , but there are Member States where industrial output contributes only 14 % of GDP .
whoever is responsible , it is totally unacceptable , utterly and totally unacceptable , that initially paragraph 3 of the text set Israel and Hamas on an equal footing .
they simply follow the gesticulations of their party tic-tac men .
I would like to remind everyone of the British Airways plane which flew through an ash cloud on its way to New Zealand in 1982 and , in particular , of the serious incident involving a KLM Boeing 747 in 1989 which flew through a thick cloud of volcanic ash .
in any case , this has been said more plausibly but also more cynically by Mr Rosenzweig , the US Assistant Secretary involved .
it has attempted to reallocate budgetary resources from the Progress programme to the microfinance facility before the European Parliament has reached a decision .
I agree with the proposal to reduce the transposition deficit of Single Market directives to 0.5 % for outstanding legislation and 0.5 % for incorrectly transposed legislation by the end of 2012 .
but after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only - with quarterly reviews !
we can neither apply a double standard , as it would undermine the authenticity of the European Union , nor can we lay down new conditions .
a privileged partnership with Turkey , instead of full membership , will be quite enough .
we do not all need to reinvent the bicycle .
we cannot imagine a better source of information , whether we are writing a book , or whether we want to make a sophisticated dish and are looking for an interesting recipe .
if we undermine the principles of accession , we have no principles left .
it is in the interests of the younger generation in Switzerland and , of course , of the young people from the countries surrounding Switzerland who would like to participate in school exchanges with Switzerland as part of the Comenius-Regio programme , or in individual school partnerships , as well as the Erasmus programme .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is clear that the confidence of consumers has been badly shaken once again and consumers are , quite naturally , asking themselves what the national authorities are doing and what is the EU doing to put a stop to the work of these contaminators .
historically , the 50-euro note has been the most counterfeited banknote , but in the second half of 2008 - for the first time - the most counterfeited banknote was the 20-euro banknote .
at the time , it was not possible to say more .
- ( ET ) Several important matters were agreed upon in the Council .
the German Presidency had set three objectives - the &apos; triple 20 &apos; - and , at its heart , the agreement that we sealed at the European Council , and that I hope will be adopted by the European Parliament tomorrow , meets the objectives you set yourselves .
I should like to condemn the death of Juan Soto García , and to denounce the lack of freedom and democracy in Cuba .
( FI ) Mr President , Commissioner , first I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Kacin , for an excellent , thorough report .
finally , the Commission welcomes the minorities and discrimination survey that was presented yesterday .
did you know that the Netherlands has been the biggest net contributor to the European Union for years now and that the Greeks have been the biggest recipients of Dutch money for years ?
we need to be careful however , that the supermarket does not also continue slashing the prices going to our farmers .
( RO ) The blacklist , updated on 30 March this year , features 278 companies from 17 countries .
lent EUR 250 million for capacity enhancement , they built new factories in Poland , Romania and Hungary .
naturally , it is the general aim to keep prices stable , but it cannot be in the interests of farmers to be the nation &apos;s or Europe &apos;s lackey in order to ensure this .
there has been indirect involvement by Russia and the United States in the conflict , and funds have come from Arab countries and China .
this amendment would also open the door to a large-scale grey market and must therefore be absolutely rejected .
that is our priority now .
( the President continued in English )
however , I also said , and I reiterate this too , that as the honourable Members know well , the time limits were as they were , so that the Council and the Commission had to take action within a very short time frame .
it is essential , however , to select the right specialisations ; the cluster initiative must be coherent , as must the whole industrial policy of the EU , and it must be appropriate and balanced .
the situation in the Mediterranean is a lesson for us in the failure to respect human rights .
therefore , in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean region , negotiations were started between the EU and its Mediterranean partners , specifically Egypt .
I support the series of amendments aimed principally at clarifying the objectives of the proposal and making them more concise .
this country has achieved a lot in the last 12 months , successfully implementing structural and economic reforms , and effectively combating corruption and organised crime .
we must accept that there will be problems and that there will be measures or actions or attitudes that may be less than perfect !
of all the taxes that we could possibly adopt , the so-called Tobin tax is the most stupid of all .
however , GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability , resource efficiency , social inclusion or social progress in general .
there are some country-specific issues .
we want to fill the gap of democratic legitimacy after all the pain we witnessed when the referenda were held .
let me say a second word on the human rights question .
for young people , unemployment is particularly worrying , as you said .
the cohesion policy has been enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
however , a further step now has to be taken .
that would be sure to improve cooperation in the Union .
Mr President , honourable Members , first of all , I am grateful to Parliament &apos;s Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and the Committee on Regional Development for the intensive debate and for the report that we are debating today .
I voted in favour of it because I consider it of fundamental importance to improve the economic governance of the European Union .
ladies and gentlemen , if we have the opportunity in Europe to exploit these new technologies and use the natural gas found in Europe to gain access to this shale gas , we could improve our common economy by reducing our dependence on imports .
it is appreciated in Northern Ireland that you should , at this time , think of those who mourn in that regard .
it advocates the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact and exchange policy and other macro-economic guidelines , as well as continuously devaluing the role of production and labour .
I am therefore in favour of the finance ministers implementing the three-point plan proposed by Mr Almunia on 22 December 2004 for strengthening Eurostat as quickly as possible .
it requires a step-by-step approach , whereby we first reach a stage of 3 % and then , in the medium term , budgetary equilibrium .
an analysis of the current situation should be carried out and , I think , a realistic timetable set as soon as possible .
the high number of children in orphanages , which we are talking about in today &apos;s debate , often does not mean children who have been abandoned , but in fact represents children of poor parents who are not coping with their difficult personal situation .
it is a proven tool and , according to the Decision , the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law .
the main export control tool is Regulation ( CE ) No 428 / 2009 , which introduced a number of significant changes to the scope of dual-use export controls -use items in the European Union .
I should like to raise a few issues .
Greece , Italy and Spain cannot deal with it alone , because these countries are under severe pressure .
well , Mr Rack , do not worry : we did begin again at exactly 12 noon and it is now 12.04 p.m. , so we are not doing too badly .
Madam President , I should like to point out to the Commissioner that , where I live , if I want to recycle any of my electrical goods , I have got to take them to a local council site myself .
fear of attacks by the PKK , anger that could lead to escalation .
we must therefore take a united approach in this fight on the basis of the rule of law and with all the force of the law .
we should not merely support but absolutely insist on respect for human rights both within the EU and in its external relations .
well , I have another hypothesis here , namely , that perhaps the women who are making it so difficult in committees , in the Commission and in this place for small businesses to employ young women have an eye to the main chance .
economic growth reached almost 3 % in 2007 .
the mandate given to the MONUC personnel on the ground will no doubt be extended , but it absolutely must be re-evaluated and strengthened , too , so that this rising tide of violence can be stemmed .
secondly , I urge that the authorities in Minsk be asked whether it is not finally time to lift all the restrictions on travel by the children of Chernobyl .
the importance of this can be seen from a glance at the terrible history of my own country , along with a glance at the human rights infringements currently taking place .
I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mrs Matias .
nobody is against transparency .
I would now ask the speakers to adhere strictly to their speaking time .
the position taken by the authorities is also puzzling because it runs counter to that adopted during the election campaign , during which we witnessed the emergence of pluralistic forces , the formation of a real opposition and an active civil society .
the Commission has requested and also received a negotiating mandate from the Council authorising it to negotiate specifically with Liechtenstein with regard to how existing weak spots in the system for combating money laundering and tax fraud can be eliminated .
the Commission has introduced measures to stabilise the financial system , which will help the banks to start lending to their customers again .
the Energy Labelling Directive has a crucial role to play in the achievement of the EU energy efficiency target of 20 % by 2020 .
solidarity or an equal chance to compete no longer means a thing .
above all , I would like to clarify , Madam President , that before taking a vote on these reports at committee level , we asked for and were given a guarantee on the part of the European Commission that full reciprocity would be ensured .
it has been adapted to the new challenges , such as the effects of globalisation , climate change and demographic changes .
that is all well and good , but there are already first signs and tendencies , expressions of opinion , that do not correspond to the consensus of what has come to be called political correctness , to restrict , to prohibit and , who knows , sooner or later , to punish .
we must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy .
we must also make clear , however - and certain countries with lower standards will soon understand this , as their standards will be raised - that freedom of movement must not result in a kind of competition becoming the norm that involves dispensing with the social standards that have evolved .
we , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece , are therefore voting against the resolution , reaffirming our position against the imperialist EU and its enlargement .
secondly , the study proposed by the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs - whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank expressly once again - raises a number of questions which are individually worth looking at , but which taken as a whole are likely to result in this proposal facing great opposition in the Council .
Europe is facing a huge economic crisis and must look for effective ways out of it .
I welcome the recent establishment of Kosovan security forces and the participation of a section of the Serbian community in Kosovo &apos;s police force .
the European Commission has undertaken , on the instructions of the Council of the European Union , to draft a proposal to transform the intergovernmental European Heritage label into a Community institution .
I therefore support the decision to conduct stress tests of nuclear power stations on EU territory .
a transport system which works well on the local level is better than a service which is terminated due to excessive regulation .
Mr President , my most important question to the Council is actually whether it considers itself fallible .
they result in higher production costs and may also distort competition with states whose legislation is less strict in this respect .
I would draw attention to the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , emphasising that sport must be valued socially , especially in the case of young people as a means of teaching them tolerance , respect and involvement .
a minimum wage is certainly a good idea , but it should be provided within a meaningful overall package of tax relief for workers and also for Europe &apos;s small and medium-sized enterprises .
I also wanted to put the other side of that , which is , of course , the instruments that we use to promote and support democracy in human rights .
I may not follow the order of the questions but will try to respond briefly to what you asked .
I believe this is the biggest crisis that we have had .
the European Commission has suitable instruments and mechanisms available for monitoring and adjusting Member States &apos; finance policies .
( applause )
the attack last July on the Iraqi PMOI camp at Ashraf in Iraq can only be described as savage and barbaric .
this will merely postpone it .
adopting this report will allow Member States to take coordinated measures to combat this disease in the European Union .
now , when President Assad begins taking brutal measures against his own people , we are , of course , dutifully condemning his actions and imposing half-hearted sanctions .
there is only one Europe , and it is our home Europe .
as we have seen - and as the whole world knows - the US administration was forced to print more money , USD 700 billion in the first stage and a further USD 600 billion in the very recent second stage .
industry in Europe is facing not only the effects of the economic crisis , but also the new challenges of the globalised era .
we know that terrorism represents a global threat and therefore needs a global concerted response , which will necessarily include increasing the flow and exchange of information , internal coordination of positions , coordination / partnerships with third countries , the implementation of a global counter-terrorism strategy with the United Nations playing a leading role , and close collaboration with various regional and international organisations involved in combating terrorism .
of course , for my group , incorporation in the report on visas of the report on biometrics looked like a fly in the ointment .
it is now more important than ever .
increasing buildings &apos; energy efficiency helps reduce the consumption of primary energy and the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
therefore , 2010 is to be the year for combating poverty .
in recent times , the Slovene ethnic minorities in Italy , Austria and Hungary have come under major pressure due to cuts in funding for their interests .
the report is balanced because it focuses on animal welfare , the problems of antibiotic resistance and cost-effectiveness as far as the farms are concerned .
I am aware of the creation of an association bringing together owners of vessels under 10 metres long in the UK fleet .
it has , moreover , encouraged the mediation efforts of the SADC , under the leadership of President Mbeki , to arrive at a more satisfactory result with regard to the choice made by the people of Zimbabwe on 29 March .
one of these underlying causes is the extreme poverty of these States , which are therefore weak and unable to fulfil their sovereign functions .
in any case , although the objective of introducing an optional instrument is to facilitate cross-border trade , taking the needs of consumers and companies into due account , it must be borne in mind that existing European legislation already satisfies the needs of the various actors involved .
( the sitting was closed at 1 p.m. )
Madam President , I am very grateful for the honourable Member &apos;s intervention .
unfortunately , however , it is unlikely that all of the European Parliament &apos;s proposals will be accepted .
combating the rise of extremism in Europe ( debate )
scarcely had such a request been made when you , Mr President , read it out here , to the jubilation of a wide range of Members .
I wish to turn now to the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , the debate on which is under way .
I would support a country of origin labelling system which promotes such standards and I believe that this will be widely acceptable to most consumers and to most within the industry .
the fact is that the Commission has long been distancing itself from the interests of the Union &apos;s citizens by pursuing its neo-liberal policy .
at the request of the Supreme Court , the Ministry of Culture has ruled that the plan will amount to a desecration of heritage , and the Constitutional Court also recently tried to stop it or ruled that it should be stopped .
against the background of this effective cooperation , there is not the slightest reason to consider changing the structures in this area .
we are on the verge of proving them wrong yet again .
this situation obliges the EU to import more than 40 million tonnes of protein crops and is a result of longstanding agreements that permit the importing of oilseed and protein crops exempt from customs duties , such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Blair House Agreement .
well aware that the work carried out by ENISA has significant community interest , I hope it will receive increased resources .
we have work to do now and we must not waste any time .
( SK ) Perhaps it is cold here also because the Commission takes very little account of our Parliament and the opinions of our Parliament .
there is an element of Europeanist ideology in this text .
Mr President , you might think that , because I am leaving this Parliament in July , I should have no views at all on the programme for Parliament in 2010 .
if there is to be any hope of successful agreements between fishing nations , then we cannot have a situation where stocks are threatened by a race to catch all the available fish on a unilateral basis .
it is also true , though , that not all countries are in a position to take rigorous action in this matter in the relatively short time that has been suggested without suffering clear economic losses .
it is simply not right .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the destiny of Europe is affected significantly by whether it is capable of developing societies that include and support children .
supporting human rights defenders has , for a long time , been an element of EU policy on human rights in external relations .
the rule of law requires that criminal responsibility should be individual and not collective .
I voted in favour of this report , but I did so only because it very specifically makes clear that there is no progress in the accession negotiations with Turkey .
why are we discussing visa waivers here ?
the planned review will not meet this requirement , which is why I have voted against it .
we would also question the benefit of such an approach .
thirdly , as usual , France has no intention of imposing any particular model and , as I said , this remains the preserve of each Member State .
we know the Commission is going to come forward with a revised recast proposal in the coming months in view of the opposition of the Council .
the other anomaly that strikes me is that , while we are allowed to select our composition , a vitally important institutional decision for the whole of the European institutions and the Union itself , we are not allowed to choose our own meeting place because of the recalcitrance of one Member State and instead are &apos; sold a pup &apos; by the City of Strasbourg that is riddled with asbestos .
the term food security highlights the need to take concrete measures to increase the global food stock : a human right that includes physical and economic access to healthy , sufficient and nutritious food .
we often say that young people are the future of Europe .
once again I welcome this EU initiative to contribute to active EU support for vaccine programmes , which when implemented have managed to significantly reduce tuberculosis infection rates , as EU Member State statistics demonstrate .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner and Vice-President Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking Mr Moreno Sánchez and the committee , as we have had a constructive discussion on Frontex and Eurosur this time , but I would also like to thank them for continuing to follow the work of Frontex so closely .
our fishing ports are sterile .
we have made considerable progress in those 100 years , but much remains to be done .
with particular regard to the Consumer Scoreboard , what methods will the Commission use to process the data obtained concerning young people of consumer age and how will the relevant information reach them ?
regulations must be honestly implemented to a common standard .
the Portuguese Presidency , under a socialist government , has an obligation to try to make a difference .
now the world has changed and these mechanisms must also be changed .
we have been seeing a steep rise in demand caused by economic and population growth and also by the desire for individual mobility .
those who maintain that there is no freedom or plurality of information in Italy are lying , and they know it .
I agree with Mr Stevenson , namely that this price rise means only a very small increase in income for farmers , compared with the trade sector , supermarket chains , and market speculators , who take the lion &apos;s share .
that is something that we have achieved in collaboration with the Council and , it must be admitted , using a certain amount of pressure - that in the medium term , we are in a position to resolve this problem .
I agree with what Mrs Wallis said about the role of the Committee on Petitions .
the policy of State aid is a crucial element of competition policy , because it allows equal opportunities to be guaranteed to all businesspeople operating in the single market .
emphasis has been given to the need to give assistance to women who want to set up their own business .
unfortunately , the ability of independent garages to compete with authorised repairers is still impaired by a number of restrictions , including limited access to spare parts and to technical information .
if we do our work on time , then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs .
in the context of the situation currently being faced by civil aviation , we believe that this draft agreement raises serious doubts about its scope and potential consequences .
mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (
it shares our ambition to build a more protective , more effective and more just European asylum system .
today President Medvedev is playing a full part in the G20 meeting in London .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I want to congratulate both our rapporteurs .
the same clichés are regularly heard , whether intentional or motivated by misunderstanding or ignorance of the issues .
that is the first message .
this is something very important .
we therefore need to screen the organs concerned before they are used .
it is about having financing and reaching a proper agreement between the Member States on a common asylum policy , on the European Asylum Office and on all the challenges we are facing .
you do not even know how you will vote today .
the last thing I wanted to say relates in fact to what Mr Schwab was saying about all the studies .
now , the link between the two is obvious .
this , of course , has created employment and , in some cases , has improved regional economy .
thank you for your support .
in other words , they require obscurity and secrecy .
in order to give the debate a stable foundation , the Member States should produce generational accounting .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - ( NL ) Madam President , the package in itself contains sound proposals for protecting consumer rights and privacy , but unfortunately it lacks coherence and so creates legal uncertainty both for businesses and for consumers , because the scope is completely unclear .
the chances of the European Union and the international community changing the basic reality in Somalia are slight .
I am talking about transparency .
while this is not perfect , it is a step in the right direction .
whether it is post office closures or fortnightly bin collections , the finger always gets pointed elsewhere and the corruptive influence of Brussels does not appear on the radar .
if the European Union really does want to develop an external policy that has some influence in the world , then it too must have a financial arm .
I am very happy to lend my support to a pan-European project that offers added value not only to Europe but also to the world in its aim of eventually eliminating tuberculosis .
( EL ) Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate Mr Capoulas Santos on his report .
the report on territorial , social and economic cohesion seeks to provide , in my view , a comprehensive framework highlighting the integrating role of cohesion policy and the contribution it makes to increasing the EU &apos;s global competitiveness .
equally , it is important to put concrete proposals on the table on reciprocity , and I welcome the fact that your report recognises the importance of reciprocity measures aimed at protecting our internal energy market .
life assurance ( implementing powers conferred on the Commission ) ( vote )
this is why we elected them - because we wanted to elect people who will make the traffic move for all European citizens to get a better life for themselves , and this is what they will do .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as I have already reminded the Commissioner , in recent months we have repeatedly addressed the issue of the classification , labelling and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures , a system better known by its abbreviation &apos; GHS &apos; , for which I am rapporteur .
thus it is more than legitimate to denounce , as we are doing in this resolution , the persecution of a number of non-governmental organisations , particularly human rights organisations , that is currently taking place in Egypt , and to lend support to the campaign for freedom of association led by a number of social movements in the country .
whilst clearing away the ruins left by your Hungarian Socialist colleagues , we are mobilising tremendous energies to make Hungary a democratic , European , and free country based on the constitutional mandate we received from the Hungarian citizens in free elections .
the European Union stresses the need to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and calls for the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the resolving of all outstanding issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , including all core issues .
just now , I want to dwell on one specific article of the new draft , which we have already talked about : Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union .
first , it rightly keeps the proportion of biofuels at 10 % , because if we have a problem in Europe it is the problem of security of supply .
unemployment , working in unsafe conditions , pension levels lower than the minimum subsistence income and difficulties in accessing decent public services are some of the main causes of the state of poverty whose nature justifies us talking about the feminisation of poverty in Europe .
&apos;4 . calls on Israel to cease military actions killing and endangering civilians , and extrajudicial targeted killings ; &apos;
however , as other Members pointed out before me , nor can it be accomplished if there is no intelligent driver who understands the rules of the road and has adequate technical knowledge .
( ES ) Mr President , this accident is certainly not comparable to other incidents involving oil tankers , or even container vessels such as the Napoli , on which the IMB still has to take a decision .
it is high time that crucifixes , which were imposed in classrooms under Mussolini , were withdrawn from the state school environment .
that is why this important tool is a good step in the right direction in the recycling of electronic waste , allowing us to guarantee better resource efficiency and the return of raw materials to producers .
I do not know whether you are still pursuing the financial transaction tax .
but , please , think about the difficulty involved .
however , the main purpose was to reimburse Bulgaria and other countries that had been forced to decommission functioning nuclear reactors , against their better judgment .
Parliament &apos;s administrative body must anticipate in the future situations like the one we have today .
it must be emphasised that Europe regards Mexico as an important partner for supplying raw materials .
we need to be ambitious .
I also want to express my gratitude to my colleagues on the &apos; Budget &apos; Council , and to all those who cooperated with them , for the firm support that they gave the Presidency . my special thanks go to Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaite who fully played her role as neutral mediator and , last but not least , I should also like to thank the staff of the three institutions who took part in these negotiations for their very valuable and professional contribution .
this is particularly good news for those who live in cross-border areas and , above all , for individuals suffering from rare diseases who need specialist treatment which is not available in their own country .
police cooperation at EU level is therefore , logically , subject to an inter-governmental approach .
in writing . - ( NL ) The former employees and the four suppliers of Opel Antwerp are still angry at the way they were treated by GM .
Thai soldiers must stop firing ; violence against protestors cannot lead , and will not lead , to a democratic solution .
instability will remain in the region , in spite of the successes achieved in ISAF operations .
with regard to the aforementioned quotas , I believe that I have been a little misunderstood .
here is the explanation of my vote .
over the past year , it has become clear that more needs to be done in this area , primarily by the Member States , but also by the European Union .
besides eliminating the gender gap in wages , the appropriate reinforcement of the role of women in the family and the assertion of the principle of equal treatment still remain to be solved .
it is very hard to ask a speaker to break off , especially when he is in full flow , but do try to keep to your speaking time .
if you look at the foundations that exist in the single market for other products , goods and services - roads , railways , airways , airports , the digital world , waterways - you can see that we are still a long way from what we need in terms of infrastructure for the transport of energy , in particular gas and electricity , in order to meet our European energy policy objectives , namely to enhance the security of supply , solidarity , competition and consumer interests .
the harmonisation of goods transport , in particular in regard to multi-modal transportation , is an absolutely vital and logical step that should have a positive effect on the EU &apos;s internal market .
a particular concern for our group , however , is the issue of energy poverty and what we are doing to address it , for this is still a very serious problem in Europe .
antibiotic resistance ( debate )
ongoing work at the OECD on the development of guidelines for mainstreaming adaptation into development cooperation will assist us in these efforts .
we have also provided for commercial incentives .
( HU ) The military junta has promised free , democratic elections for 2010 .
we also see , from INFSO , the success of the work related to the enhanced consumer confidence in roaming , and this is just the beginning .
however , on reflection , and having listened to the arguments , I am now convinced that we can keep that multilingual access , albeit in a new form .
these all exist , and it is precisely if we express our concerns about this that the regional elections could , in my opinion , take place in a much better atmosphere .
so if we are now saying that there will be a 100 % sure braking system which avoids human error - it is not true .
have we learnt nothing from the Second World War ?
the economic crisis has become a challenge for the whole world , but is also an opportunity to deepen and to reformulate transatlantic relations .
although the coal mining industry does not have a great bearing on the Lithuanian economy , this report is important for my country .
I would like to point out in this regard that , when my report on equality between women and men was adopted in 2009 , the majority of MEPs supported the view that women had to have easy access to contraception and abortion .
on the one hand , it provides updated , rapid and public information on the formation of political parties at European level and their common European status .
to avoid tax evasion , it is also vitally important that the three countries that are exempt from the current information exchange system - Belgium , Luxembourg and Austria - are included in the system the other countries employ .
both of them think that the few intervention measures that still remain should be completely phased out , subjecting agriculture to the &apos; free market &apos; .
some of that money has not yet been used for Italy , and we have been working with the Italian authorities on an almost daily basis to see how programme financing can be reallocated so that it can be used to address the situation in Lampedusa .
it is no wonder that many attempt to leave Burma as they have no other option .
therefore the European Council in March called upon the Council and the Commission to submit before the June European Council a plan for the development of capacities to manage migration and refugee flows as a response .
is the Council prepared to accept that ?
I find myself going from conference to conference , from Member State to Member State , like a living Tibetan prayer wheel , pleading the case for these resources - which are already in place - to be used .
the rapporteur points out the advantages which the euro brings but also the risks and problems which may arise .
we saw enthusiasm and gratefulness and I believe , Commissioner , that development must be taken into account in all European Union policies .
but I believe that the abuses and injustice committed in the name of the law are unacceptable , induce fear and humiliation and may instigate hatred within human communities .
( DE ) Mr President , I have a question for Mr Pöttering : will you still have the right to vote in this Parliament ?
if the British Government wants to make savings , it can join the euro , it can give the European Union more powers and responsibilities , and it can make savings with regard to all those people working on monetary policy in Britain .
along with President Barroso , I feel very much encouraged by today &apos;s debate in Parliament .
terrorist networks aim at undermining regional peace and stability ; they should not be allowed to succeed .
there is simply no alternative here .
a parliament that has self-respect does not ditch its traditional archiving system .
I agree , and I should know .
( DE ) Madam President , as you know , there are now 28 countries , including 25 EU Member States , which have done away with passenger traffic controls at common borders .
then we will have done a good job .
the latter absolutely must include bold targets and innovative measures .
we often say that Europe &apos;s small businesses are the heart of the European economy .
the report by Mrs Lilli Gruber , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the policy plan on legal migration and
interfering with these dumps could result in an enormous ecological disaster .
I would go so far as to say that most of these micro-entities - and this is confirmed by the Commission &apos;s research - do not understand their own accounts at all .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I shall be very brief because much has been said .
the final type concerns the method for conducting the elections .
we are talking about energy which is supplied to Europe , and which should be covered by EU policy , in the same way as gas or other sources of energy .
the RoHS Directive and the Council Resolution of 28 January 1988 on a Community action programme to combat environmental pollution by cadmium are principally targeted against the use of cadmium , as Europe is a region particularly at risk from this cumulative carcinogenic poison .
this must actually be achieved by the limit values set , as otherwise such a directive is worthless .
these animals have suffered premature ageing or other diseases .
we should , therefore , draw the right conclusions with regard to both institutional and practical solutions .
- ( CS ) Madam President , I very much applaud the fact that Mr Schwab has reached a compromise with the Council strengthening the rights of consumers , and that the compromise will also include my proposals for online commerce .
we therefore anticipate taking advantage of the opportunity that is being given to invest in improving the energy efficiency of buildings and the potential to create millions of jobs in the next few years .
I have only one minute &apos;s speaking time now , so I won &apos;t bring up any special policy issues .
procurement policy , which prohibits preferment for local contractors and workers , is stoking up more and more resentment of the EU and its inflexible regime .
we are sending a large delegation to the G20 summit where the subject of how the financial crisis can be overcome will be discussed .
this is not just a problem in developing countries but also in eastern Europe .
whether we are talking about the amount of the deposit , the number of signatures required , the checks on this - look at what happened in St Petersburg a few months ago - on not one of these points do they meet the criteria that we and the rest of the world would consider constitute free and fair elections .
I just want to react to some points and prepare for further cooperation , because we are not at the end .
I would add that the Council &apos;s common position introduces an explicit opt-out review clause .
when revising expenditure programmes , the Court suggests applying a set of principles to ensure that European added value is likely , that the objectives are clear , that the schemes are as realistic and simple as is reasonably possible , and that accountability is also clear .
the Italian authorities , using the European early warning system , have informed the other EU Member States of a tropical fever epidemic caused by the chikungunya virus in the province of Emilia-Romagna .
by putting a stop to forced collectivisation and the confiscation of food stocks , the leaders of the Soviet Union could have saved millions of human lives , but they did not do so .
it is important to point out that prospective EU membership was one of the driving forces behind development and reforms in countries in the Balkan region .
if it wants to make savings in Great Britain , it can do so in the research sector simply by adopting the European patent immediately .
the commitment to such a strategic partnership was clearly expressed by Vice President Joe Biden in this House just a few months ago .
it was &apos; how can we achieve better harmonisation : getting people to work together better , dividing up the work better , supporting global development policy better between the various partners ; the role of the World Bank , the World Trade Organisation , the International Monetary Fund , the Commission and all the large-scale donors ? &apos;
we have therefore not seen the last of such behaviour , of that I am sure .
Monday
rather than investing billions of euro in new nuclear plants , we need to invest that money in developing renewable energy sources .
in conclusion , I reiterate that the European Union is alone in developing a firm dialogue with all the emerging countries and which applies to each partner the same human rights criteria , with a compulsory clause appearing in all new agreements from 1995 that requires respect for international law , whether it is in the form of the International Criminal Court , the United Nations conventions on political rights or the application of social and environmental rights .
I am sure that , as the Chinese ambassador also emphasised during the meeting with us today , the US , the European Union and China will assume their responsibility when they sit down at the negotiating table and will lead the way in the efforts to achieve a new agreement guaranteeing the safety of future generations .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the time has come for this House to stop the endless debate on the Treaty of Lisbon , which we have still heard going on today .
I think it is very important to convey to the authorities in Belarus that they must comply with the commitments that they have made in the OSCE to respect human rights and to protect minorities as an essential part of respecting human rights .
you have become totally indifferent to the fate of European workers .
Copenhagen will only succeed if we can convey this message of shared responsibility and solidarity .
I am pleased to note that they share our concern .
( HU ) As a rapporteur , or in this case draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for the report on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms , I wish to emphasise again that the European Parliament must be given a greater role in supervising procedures .
finally , my other question relates to the timing , and you spoke about the difficulty with the Commission and the budgetary authority .
thirdly , I hope that we will be able to demonstrate with this programme that there is European added value for everyone .
it must also be remembered that the European Court of Human Rights rejected Mr Battisti &apos;s request for protection and that the European Union now bases its action on the respect of fundamental human rights , which is an essential component of the European Constitution .
we approve of sending an EU police and justice mission to support the authorities in Kosovo .
in the light of this , the Council has asked the Presidency and the Commission , in close cooperation with the SIS II Task Force and in consultation with the appropriate bodies , to present the Council with a report containing a detailed assessment and comparison of the two scenarios .
this is why we should open up to the citizens of Belarus , and also make it easier for them to obtain visas .
recently , the Chief Official Ethics Commission of Lithuania penalised Mr Tomaševski , leader of the Polish minority and a Member of the European Parliament , for putting a question to Mr Barroso about respect for the rights of minorities .
I should like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mr Grosch and Mrs Ţicău , once more for the constructive exchange of views .
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia : progress report 2008 ( vote )
( SK ) The protection of minorities is indisputably one of the most important principles , and in my country , the Slovak Republic , a really exceptionally high standard of protection is guaranteed for minorities .
we look forward to rapid progress on that , including the question of minimum income , so that people can live in dignity .
with the new CAP we must give - and this is what we are in fact doing - strong support to farm incomes under the first pillar and support measures for rural development , increasing investment in agriculture and food security .
while a number of countries around the world have already adopted an immigration policy with fairly satisfactory results , most of our countries have delayed these choices .
as you all know , Member States have the opportunity to levy higher infrastructure charges during peak periods .
therefore , we in Europe must not be afraid of criticising the Israelis and the Palestinians .
there is , admittedly , a real risk of an &apos; à la carte Europe &apos; , yet faced with the reluctance of some , entrenched in their national identities , we must act .
this is the case in countries with very large dealers that have the capacity to distribute several brands - for example in the UK - and it is also the case in sparsely-populated areas , where it makes economic sense for the dealers to sell different brands from the same site .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Christensen &apos;s report has been crucial in taking forward the initial document .
one of the first things the Commission proposed back then was the White Paper on Food Safety , which , I believe , proposed 83 measures to ensure food safety in the European Union .
in writing . - The relationship between the UK and other European countries with the US will continue to be our most important strategic priority for decades to come .
we cannot exclude human error or technical failures and therefore both of these things play a role in rail safety .
there is still one EU-subsidised cigarette in every packet .
this can be guaranteed primarily with the support of small and medium-sized businesses , which are one of the main engines within the national economies .
as every one of us can imagine , every extra day in captivity means awful suffering for Shalit and his family .
you are right to do so , since this is quite simply in line with the association agreement and with the commitments that Tunisia has made to the European Union .
we talk here endlessly about promoting entrepreneurs ; we talk about allowing them to flourish in the European Union .
I voted in favour of including milk in Article 186 in order to enable the Commission to respond rapidly to crisis situations , since it introduces an instrument that is important to use .
the role of forests in the European Union &apos;s energy strategy is another important point because their potential as a renewable energy source is currently underexploited .
above all , this means learning lessons from the failure of the previous approach .
Madam President , our questions have been framed with the intention of highlighting the benefits our citizens can expect from such a package of measures and what we are able to offer in such a package .
yet , migratory flows affect Member States differently .
I agree with the general approach of the report and , in particular , with the statement that the European Union must promote humanitarian principles unstintingly .
in terms of natural resources and biodiversity , in particular , the ORs allow European research privileged access to tropical ecosystems endowed with a unique biodiversity and agriculture .
( DE ) Madam President , it is a question of us , as the European Union , following a clear strategy and preventing a gold or gemstone rush .
as I said earlier , we are keeping a close eye on the new technologies that will , I hope , enable us to simplify these procedures .
that is what this is all about .
the judgment should not entrap us into continuing to authorise minimum standards alone in future for posted workers .
it is now time to assess matters , but through an assessment in a crisis period we clearly need to find the means to get things moving again .
improvements in water quality , the functioning of transport and tourism , and agriculture go hand in hand .
since this is my last debate with Meglena Kuneva , I would like to express my thanks for the fact that our cooperation has been so incredibly pleasant .
this , because Europe cannot afford the luxury of renouncing the option of alternative gas production that could be exploited within the EU in an age where the traditional gas sources of the North Sea are being depleted .
admittedly , these benefits will only become apparent over time because of the gradual introduction of the new regulations and the transitional clauses announced by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision on 12 September 2010 .
until we move forward in these areas , the cost of any compensatory damages will be borne by innocent taxpayers .
the creation of the European research area , which I fully support , is actually exactly this idea - that we all know what we are doing and that we join the scientific expertise which we already have across Europe .
an obese diabetic mother will have obese children , and so it goes on from generation to generation .
a future is not built by partitioning a country : it is built by rebuilding its economy , with mutual recognition of different communities and cultures and application of the rule of law .
it is hard to imagine how the United States could otherwise pay the enormous debts it is only now incurring and how , in a time of inflation , the weakening of the value of money , it will respond to its own worsening ability to pay off its debts and normalise its overpriced assets .
it is interesting that we are debating this subject on the eve of the G20 .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Radwan , ladies and gentlemen , I warmly welcome this report and this debate because I think we are probing some really sensitive issues , and we are doing so on a genuinely cross-party basis .
I should now like to ask the President of the European Commission , José Manuel Durão Barroso , to be kind enough to speak to us .
but you have very much opened this discussion .
as they are amended , it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force .
the report therefore calls for closer , thorough monitoring by the Commission , with regular implementation reports .
we are glad that we have your support on these technical issues .
( NL ) Madam President , first of all , I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate Mr Becsey and also to thank him for the sound collaboration that we enjoyed in relation to the report on micro-credit .
of course the European Parliament cannot wave a magic wand and bring this conflict to an end , but I assure you that it will put human rights at the heart of the review of Israel &apos;s status , which will be debated throughout this year .
it is therefore very important to urge all parties in this conflict to cease hostilities so that the people of those regions can once again live in a climate of peace .
I want to point out even so that the PNR exchange of data is governed by the 2007 agreement between the European Union and the United States .
( PL ) In September 2007 , on the basis of the decision of the European Parliament and the Council in 2006 and with regard to the matter of - amongst other things - the Nabucco gas pipeline , a European coordinator for the project was appointed , namely Mr Josias Van Aartsen .
many of the other perpetrators are also still at large , and some are even still living in Bosnia-Herzegovina among the bereaved families of the victims .
if having free trade agreements means that we allow products to enter Europe that respect neither our social standards nor our environmental standards , the reform of the common agricultural policy will be pointless .
the structure is there , the environmental targets are in place , but the tools have become weaker through the actions of the Member States .
there has been talk for a long time about improving working conditions for women but , unfortunately , nothing is changing .
Greece is one of the Member States which still face significant problems in properly implementing the directive .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a short time ago I heard some very serious and even slanderous statements made by a Maltese fellow Member against the Italian Government and Minister Maroni in particular .
today , on this issue , we have to be brutally honest .
the Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard .
pension systems fall under the competence of the Member States .
naturally , we are aware of the unique nature of the Service , which also reflects that of the role of the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission , just as we are aware of the fact that the Service must not incorporate all of the services used by the Commission when it implements the numerous aspects of its external action - which does not just boil down to the CFSP - starting with development cooperation .
EU position and commitment in advance of the UN high-level meeting on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (
I think his report shows that , at all events , the European Parliament wants to see a great deal more ambition in this field .
I think that we should also give special recognition to the approach adopted by Commissioner Barrot , the Directorate-General concerned and the German Presidency .
