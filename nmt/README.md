# Kama NMT models

We have done experiments on word-level and character-level machine translation with neural networks. You can find the model files, translation quality estimations and references to used software in the [word2word](http://github.com/fishel/kama/tree/master/nmt/word2word) and [chr2chr](http://github.com/fishel/kama/tree/master/nmt/chr2chr) subfolders.
