# Kama

Kama: Usable Estonian Machine Translation (kasutatav masint√µlge) is a National Programme for Estonian Language Technology project (2015-2017) focusing on improving machine translation from/into Estonian and making sure that its output is usable in practice for specific text domains, for example for post-editing.

Here we publicly distribute the latest SMT and NMT models that we have developed.

## Models

The model files are too big for GitHub, find them [here](http://statmt.ut.ee/kama).
